"Left-wing politics supports social equality and egalitarianism, often in opposition to social hierarchy.",1
Far-left politics are politics further to the left of the left–right political spectrum than the standard political left.,1
Extremist far-left politics can involve violent acts and the formation of far-left militant organizations meant to abolish capitalist systems and the upper ruling class.,1
"Centre-left politics or center-left politics, also referred to as moderate-left politics, are political views that lean to the left-wing on the left–right political spectrum, but closer to the centre than other left-wing politics.",1
"Despite the rise of centre-left politics in continental Europe, Britain and its colonies, along with the United States, only saw the rise of the centre-left in the late 19th century to the early 20th century.",1
"Left-wing market anarchism is a strand of free-market anarchism and an individualist anarchist, left-libertarian and libertarian socialist political philosophy and market socialist economic theory associated with contemporary scholars such as Kevin Carson, Gary Chartier, Charles W.

"Proponents of left communism have included Amadeo Bordiga, Onorato Damen, Jacques Camatte, Herman Gorter, Antonie Pannekoek, Otto Rühle, Sylvia Pankhurst and Paul Mattick.",1
The historical origins of left communism come from World War I.,1
Left communism first came into focus as a distinct movement around 1918.,1
"Left-wing terrorism or far-left terrorism, sometimes called Marxist–Leninist  terrorism or revolutionary/left-wing terrorism, is terrorism meant to overthrow capitalist systems and replace them with Marxist–Leninist or socialist societies.",1
Left-wing terrorism also occurs within already socialist states as activism against the current ruling government.,1
"Since then, left-wing terrorism has been minor compared with other forms, and is mostly carried out by insurgent groups in the developing world.",1
Other researchers argue that left-wing terrorism may not be less indiscriminate than its right-wing counterpart.,1
Modern left-wing terrorism developed in the context of the political unrest of 1968.,1
"Incidents of left-wing terrorism dropped off at the end of the Cold War, partly due to the loss of support for communism.",1
"The Old Left is the pre-1960s left-wing in the Western world, the earlier leftist or Marxist movements that had often taken a more vanguardist approach to social justice and focused mostly on labor unionization and questions of social class in the West.",1
"Unlike today's new left, the old left promoted an immigration policy that would keep the country ethnically homogeneous.",1
"Arthur Calwell, another old leftist who led the Australian Labour Party in the 1960s strongly defended the White Australia Policy and said the following: ""I am proud of my white skin, just as a Chinese is proud of his yellow skin, a Japanese of his brown skin, and the Indians of their various hues from black to coffee-coloured.",1
"The anti-Stalinist left comprises various kinds of left-wing politics opposing Joseph Stalin, Stalinism and the actual system of governance Stalin implemented as dictator of the Soviet Union between 1927–1953.",1
An anti-Stalinist left emerged in the former Soviet bloc in the early 1990s.,1
"The New Left was a broad political movement mainly in the 1960s and 1970s consisting of activists in the Western world who campaigned for a broad range of social issues such as civil and political rights, feminism, gay rights, abortion rights, gender roles and drug policy reforms.",1
"Some saw the New Left as an oppositional reaction to earlier Marxist and labor union movements for social justice that focused on dialectical materialism and social class, while others who used the term saw the movement as a continuation and revitalization of traditional leftist goals.Some who self-identified as ""New Left"" rejected involvement with the labor movement and Marxism's historical theory of class struggle, although others gravitated to their own takes on established forms of Marxism, such as the New Communist movement in the United States or the K-Gruppen in the German Sprachraum.",1
"It was from this French ""new left"" that the ""First New Left"" of Britain borrowed the term.The German-Jewish critical theorist Herbert Marcuse is referred to as the ""Father of the New Left"".",1
"Another prominent New Left thinker, Ernst Bloch, believed that socialism would prove the means for all human beings to become immortal and eventually create God.The writings of sociologist C. Wright Mills, who popularized the term New Left in a 1960 open letter, would also give great inspiration to the movement.",1
"The New Left emerged in Latin America, a group which sought to go beyond existing Marxist–Leninist efforts at achieving economic equality and democracy to include social reform and address issues unique to Latin America such as racial and ethnic equality, indigenous rights, the rights of the environment, demands for radical democracy, international solidarity, anti-colonialism, anti-imperialism and other aims.",1
"Some within the British New Left joined the International Socialists, which later became Socialist Workers Party while others became involved with groups such as the International Marxist Group.",1
"The politics of the British New Left can be contrasted with Solidarity, which continued to focus primarily on industrial issues.Another significant figure in the British New Left was Stuart Hall, a black cultural theorist in Britain.",1
"The New Left Review, in an obituary following Hall's death in February 2014, wrote ""His exemplary investigations came close to inventing a new field of study, 'cultural studies'; in his vision, the new discipline was profoundly political in inspiration and radically interdisciplinary in character.",1
"""Among Hall's New Left works were the May Day Manifesto, which reflected a ""growing disillusionment on the left with what the authors argued to be the surrendering of socialist principles by the Labour Party"" and Policing the Crisis: Mugging, the State and Law and Order, which contemporary book reviewer John Horton described as ""nothing less than an analysis of how the British state is managing the current 'crisis of hegemony'"".",1
"Instead they called for a ""new left .",1
"The New Left that developed in the years that followed was ""a loosely organized, mostly white student movement that advocated for democracy, civil rights, and various types of university reforms, and protested against the Vietnam war"".The term ""New Left"" was popularised in the United States in an open letter written in 1960 by sociologist C. Wright Mills entitled Letter to the New Left.",1
"Mills argued for a new leftist ideology, moving away from the traditional focus on labor issues, into a broader focus towards issues such as opposing alienation, anomie, and authoritarianism.",1
"""The New Left opposed what it saw as the prevailing authority structures in society, which it termed ""The Establishment"", and those who rejected this authority became known as ""anti-Establishment"".",1
"The New Left focused on social activists and their approach to organization, convinced that they could be the source for a better kind of social revolution.",1

"Today, the existing communist states in the world are in China, Cuba, Laos and Vietnam.",1
"These communist states often do not claim to have achieved socialism or communism in their countries, but to be building and working toward the establishment of socialism in their countries.",1
The constitutions of most communist states describe their political system as a form of democracy.,1
A feature of communist states is the existence of numerous state-sponsored social organizations which are integrated into the political system.,1
"In communist states, the social organizations are expected to promote social unity and cohesion, to serve as a link between the government and society and to provide a forum for recruitment of new communist party members.Historically, the political organization of many socialist states has been dominated by a one-party monopoly.",1
"In communist states, the government may not tolerate criticism of policies that have already been implemented in the past or are being implemented in the present.",1
"However, the goal of the communist state is to abolish that said state.",1
"The communist state is the dictatorship of the proletariat, were the advanced elements of the proletariat are the ruling class.",1
"The communist states have opted for two ways to achieve this goal, namely govern indirectly by Marxism–Leninism through the party, or commit the state officially through the constitution to Marxism–Leninism.",1
A number of the short-lived communist states which formed during World War I and its aftermath called themselves people's republics.,1
"In addition, all communist states the ruling party has either had a clear majority such as China, or held every seats as they did in the Soviet Union in their national legislature.Western researchers have devoted little attention to legislatures in communist states.",1
This might explain why communist states have not developed terms such as delegates and trustees to give legislature representatives to vote according to their best judgement or in the interest of their constituency.,1
"Communist states are committed to establish a classless society and use legislatures to show that all social strata, whether bureaucrat, worker or intellectual, are committed and have interests in building such a society.",1
"In communist states, there is usually a high proportion of members who are government officials.",1
A constitution in a communist state has an end.,1
None of the surviving communist states have experimented with constitutional supervision committees or constitutional supervision of anykind outside the existing framework.,1

The Marxist conception of socialism is that of a specific historical phase that would displace capitalism and precede communism.,1
The major characteristics of socialism are that the proletariat would control the means of production through a workers' state erected by the workers in their interests.,1
"For orthodox Marxists, socialism is the lower stage of communism based on the principle of ""from each according to his ability, to each according to his contribution"" while upper stage communism is based on the principle of ""from each according to his ability, to each according to his need"", the upper stage becoming possible only after the socialist stage further develops economic efficiency and the automation of production has led to a superabundance of goods and services.",1
"Variations of market socialism include libertarian proposals such as mutualism, based on classical economics, and neoclassical economic models such as the Lange Model.",1

There are many variations of socialism and as such there is no single definition encapsulating all of socialism.,1
"In his Dictionary of Socialism, Angelo S. Rappoport analysed forty definitions of socialism to conclude that common elements of socialism include: general criticisms of the social effects of private ownership and control of capital—as being the cause of poverty, low wages, unemployment, economic and social inequality and a lack of economic security; a general view that the solution to these problems is a form of collective control over the means of production, distribution and exchange; an agreement that the outcome of this collective control should be a society based upon social justice, including social equality, economic protection of people and should provide a more satisfying life for most people.",1

"Barrès claimed that authoritarian democracy involved spiritual connection between a leader of a nation and the nation's people, and that true freedom did not arise from individual rights nor parliamentary restraints, but through ""heroic leadership"" and ""national power"".In the fascist and quasi-fascist regimes that governed Italy, Romania, and Spain from the 1920s to the 1970s, authoritarian democracy was promoted as an alternative to liberal democracy, multi-party based democracy was dismantled and replaced by corporatist representation of state-sanctioned corporate groups that would unite people into interest groups to address the state that would act in the interest of the general will of the nation and thus exercise an orderly form of popular rule.",1
Italian Fascists argued that this authoritarian democracy is capable of representing the different interests of society that advise the state and the state acts in the interest of the nation.,1

"Deliberative democracy differs from traditional democratic theory in that authentic deliberation, not mere voting, is the primary source of legitimacy for the law.",1
"While deliberative democracy is generally seen as some form of an amalgam of representative democracy and direct democracy, the actual relationship is usually open to dispute.",1
"The term ""deliberative democracy"" was originally coined by Joseph M. Bessette in his 1980 work Deliberative Democracy: The Majority Principle in Republican Government.",1
"In elitist deliberative democracy, principles of deliberative democracy apply to elite societal decision-making bodies, such as legislatures and courts; in populist deliberative democracy, principles of deliberative democracy apply to groups of lay citizens who are empowered to make decisions.",1
One purpose of populist deliberative democracy can be to use deliberation among a group of lay citizens to distill a more authentic public opinion about societal issues but not directly create binding law; devices such as the deliberative opinion poll have been designed to achieve this goal.,1
"Another purpose of populist deliberative democracy can be to serve as a form of direct democracy, where deliberation among a group of lay citizens forms a ""public will"" and directly creates binding law.",1
"Cohen presents deliberative democracy as more than a theory of legitimacy, and forms a body of substantive rights around it based on achieving ""ideal deliberation"":

It is free in two ways:
The participants consider themselves bound solely by the results and preconditions of the deliberation.",1
"Deliberative democracy takes on the role of an ""epistemic democracy"" in this way, as it thus has an epistemic value: it allows participants to deduce what is morally correct.",1
"Deliberative democracy produces less partisanship and more sympathy with opposing views; more respect for evidence-based reasoning rather than opinion; a greater commitment to the decisions taken by those involved; and a greater chance for widely shared consensus to emerge, thus promoting social cohesion between people from different backgrounds.",1
"In these cases, deliberative democracy is not connected to left-wing politics but is intended to create a conversation among people of different philosophies and beliefs.",1

Media Democracy encompasses this idea by advocating for ideas such as free and independent press.,1
Media democracy is a democratic approach to media studies that advocates for the reform of mass media to strengthen public service broadcasting and develop participation in alternative media and citizen journalism in order to create a mass media system that informs and empowers all members of society and enhances democratic values.,1
Media democracy entails that media should be used to promote democracy as well as the conviction that media should be democratic itself; media ownership concentration is not democratic and cannot serve to promote democracy and therefore must be examined critically.,1
The concept of a media democracy follows in response to the deregulation of broadcast markets and the concentration of mass media ownership.,1
"The relationship of media democracy and the public sphere extends to various types of media, such as social media and mainstream media, in order for people to communicate with one another through digital media and share the information they want to publish to the public.The public sphere can be seen as a theater in modern societies in which political participation is enacted through a medium of talk and a realm of social life which public opinion can be formed.",1
"Media democracy advocates that corporate ownership and commercial pressures influence media content, sharply limiting the range of news, opinions, and entertainment citizens receive.",1
"A media democracy advocates:

Replacing the current corporate media model with one that operates democratically, rather than for profit
Strengthening public service broadcasting
Incorporating the use of alternative media into the larger discourse
Increasing the role of citizen journalism
Turning a passive audience into active participants
Using the mass media to promote democratic idealsThe competitive structure of the mass media landscape stands in opposition to democratic ideals since the competition of the marketplace affects how stories are framed and transmitted to the public.",1
"""Media democracy is grounded in creating a mass media system that favours a diversity of voices and opinions over ownership or consolidation, in an effort to eliminate bias in coverage.",1
"So while media democracy in practice as alternative or citizen journalism may allow for greater diversity, these theorists argue that women's voices are framed within a masculine structure of objectivity and rationalist thinking.Despite this criticism, there is an acceptance among some theorists that the blurring of public and private information with the introduction of some new alternative forms of media production may signal a positive shift towards a more democratic and inclusive media democracy.",1
"Some forms of media democracy in practice are challenging journalism's central tenets by rejecting the idea that it is possible to tell a narrative without bias and, more to the point, that it is socially or morally preferable.",1

"Art Nouveau jewellery encompassed many distinct features including a focus on the female form and an emphasis on colour, most commonly rendered through the use of enamelling techniques including basse-taille, champleve, cloisonné, and plique-à-jour.",1
"Early jewellery making in China started around the same period, but it became widespread with the spread of Buddhism around 2,000 years ago.",1
The Chinese often placed their jewellery in their graves.,1
"Jewellery in the Indus Valley was worn predominantly by females, who wore numerous clay or shell bracelets on their wrists.",1
"Although women wore jewellery the most, some men in the Indus Valley wore beads.",1
"Today, many of the jewellery designs and traditions are used, and jewellery is commonplace in Indian ceremonies and weddings.",1
"Jewellery making developed in the Americas 5,000 years ago in Central and South America.",1
Gold jewellery was most common in the Aztec Empire and was often decorated with feathers from Quetzal birds and others.,1
"In general, the more jewellery an Aztec noble wore, the higher his status or prestige.",1
Native American jewellery reflects the cultural diversity and history of its makers.,1
"Artists create jewellery for adornment, ceremonies, and trade.",1
"Later, jewellery and personal adornment ""...signaled resistance to assimilation.",1
Contemporary Native American jewellery ranges from hand-quarried and processed stones and shells to computer-fabricated steel and titanium jewellery.,1
"Early Pacific jewellery was made of bone, wood, and other natural materials, and thus has not survived.",1
"Most Pacific jewellery is worn above the waist, with headdresses, necklaces, hair pins, and arm and waist belts being the most common pieces.",1
"Jewellery in the Pacific, with the exception of Australia, is worn to be a symbol of either fertility or power.",1
Island jewellery is still very much primal because of the lack of communication with outside cultures.,1
"Other than jewellery created through Māori influence, modern jewellery in New Zealand is multicultural and varied.",1
"The ""jewellery as art"" movement was spearheaded by artisans such as Robert Lee Morris and continued by designers such as Gill Forsbrook in the UK.",1
"grills, a type of jewellery worn over the teeth.",1
Artisan jewellery continues to grow as both a hobby and a profession.,1
Some fine examples of artisan jewellery can be seen at The Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City.,1
"Common jewellery pieces such as earrings are a form of body modification, as they are accommodated by creating a small hole in the ear.",1
"In many cultures, jewellery is used as a temporary body modifier; in some cases, with hooks or other objects being placed into the recipient's skin.",1
Many extreme-jewellery shops now cater to people wanting large hooks or spikes set into their skin.,1
A foundry is a factory that produces metal castings.,1
"For example, an iron foundry may use a cupola, induction furnace, or EAF, while a steel foundry will use an EAF or induction furnace.",1
"A machinist is a tradesperson who machines using hand tools and machine tools to create or modify a part that is made of metal, plastics, or wood, although plastics or wood machining is rarely manufactured by machinists as those materials require lesser skill and almost all the work performed by a machinist is done on metal.",1
A machinist is to metal what a carpenter or cabinet maker is to wood.,1
"A machinist may work on manufacturing something simple like a motorcycle frame part, a piece of an internal combustion motor, or something extraordinarily complex, such as pieces of submarine engines accurate to 2 micrometers.",1
Good machinists are highly sought after and respected skilled trades persons and are generally well-paid.,1
"A machinist is one who is called on to fix a problem with a part or to create a new one using metal working, plastic, or in some cases, wood.",1
"Depending on the company, a machinist can be any or all of the titles listed above.",1
"Under the machinist title are other specialty titles that refer to specific skills that may be more highly developed to meet the needs of a particular job position, such as fitter, turning hand, mill hand, and grinder.",1
The machinist works with the quality department to ensure the specifications are maintained in the finished product.,1
Large commercial organizations often staff machinists on site in a maintenance mode to ensure continuing operations of the production machinery.,1
"Materials that machinists work with occasionally are plastics, rubber, glass, and wood products.",1
"Rarely, machinists also work with exotic and refractory metals.",1
"A machinist deals with all facets of shaping, cutting and some aspects of forming metal, although forming is typically a separate trade.",1
"A machine tool is a machine for handling or machining metal or other rigid materials, usually by cutting, boring, grinding, shearing, or other forms of deformation.",1
Machine tools employ some sort of tool that does the cutting or shaping.,1
All machine tools have some means of constraining the workpiece and provide a guided movement of the parts of the machine.,1
"While all machine tools are ""machines that help people to make things"", not all factory machines are machine tools.",1
"Today machine tools are typically powered other than by human muscle, used to make manufactured parts in various ways that include cutting or certain other kinds of deformation.",1
"With their inherent precision, machine tools enabled the economical production of interchangeable parts.",1
"This ancient concept predates machine tools per se; the earliest lathes and potter's wheels incorporated it for the workpiece, but the movement of the tool itself on these machines was entirely freehand.",1
"The value that machine tools added to these human talents is in the areas of rigidity of force fighting against the constraint), accuracy and precision, efficiency, and productivity.",1
"With a machine tool, toolpaths that no human muscle could constrain can be constrained; and toolpaths that are technically possible with freehand methods, but would require tremendous time and skill to execute, can instead be executed quickly and easily, even by people with little freehand talent.",1
"The latter aspect of machine tools is often referred to by historians of technology as ""building the skill into the tool"", in contrast to the toolpath-constraining skill being in the person who wields the tool.",1
Many reports on machine tool export and import and similar economic topics use this broader definition.,1
"In fact, machine tool builders are already developing machines that include both subtractive and additive manufacturing in one work envelope, and retrofits of existing machines are underway.The natural language use of the terms varies, with subtle connotative boundaries.",1
Historians of machine tools often focus on a handful of major industries that most spurred machine tool development.,1
Machine tools filled a need created by textile machinery during the Industrial Revolution in England in the middle to late 1700s.,1
The first machine tools offered for sale were constructed by Matthew Murray in England around 1800.,1
"Important early machine tools included the slide rest lathe, screw-cutting lathe, turret lathe, milling machine, pattern tracing lathe, shaper, and metal planer, which were all in use before 1840.",1
With these machine tools the decades-old objective of producing interchangeable parts was finally realized.,1
American production of machine tools was a critical factor in the Allies' victory in World War II.,1
Production of machine tools tripled in the United States in the war.,1
Machine tool innovation continues in several public and private research centers worldwide.,1
"David Wilkinson
Machine tools can be powered from a variety of sources.",1
The largest producer of machine tools was China with $23.8 billion of production followed by Germany and Japan at neck and neck with $12.9 billion and $12.88 billion respectively.,1

A CNC machine processes a  piece of material to meet specifications by following a coded programmed instruction and without a manual operator.,1
"A CNC machine is a motorized maneuverable tool and often a motorized maneuverable platform, which are both controlled by a computer, according to specific input instructions.",1
Instructions are delivered to a CNC machine in the form of a sequential program of machine control instructions such as G-code and then executed.,1
CNC is a vast improvement over non-computerized machining that must be manually controlled (e.g.,1
"In modern CNC systems, the design of a mechanical part and its manufacturing program is highly automated.",1
Most new CNC systems built today are 100% electronically controlled.,1
CNC-like systems are used for any process that can be described as movements and operations.,1
Many CNC tools have no inherent sense of the absolute position of the table or tools when turned on.,1
Many CNC tools also do not know anything about their working environment.,1
"Instead, most hobby CNC tools simply rely on the assumed accuracy of stepper motors that rotate a specific number of degrees in response to magnetic field changes.",1
Commercial CNC metalworking machines use closed loop feedback controls for axis movement.,1
"CNC tools with a large amount of mechanical backlash can still be highly precise if the drive or cutting mechanism is only driven so as to apply cutting force from one direction, and all driving systems are pressed tightly together in that one cutting direction.",1
However a CNC device with high backlash and a dull cutting tool can lead to cutter chatter and possible workpiece gouging.,1
"Smid, Peter, CNC Programming Handbook (3rd ed.",1
"CNC Infomatic, Automotive Design & Production.",1
Tool and die makers are a class of machinists in the manufacturing industries.,1
"Tool and die makers work primarily in toolroom environments—sometimes literally in one room but more often in an environment with flexible, semipermeable boundaries from production work.",1
Manufacturing engineers and tool and die makers often work in close consultation as part of a manufacturing engineering team.,1
Today's tool and die makers are generally required to have all of the traditional skills plus substantial digital skills; these formidable requirements make the field challenging to master.,1
Many tool and die makers attend a 4- to 5-year apprenticeship program to achieve the status of a journeyman tool and die maker.,1
"In the United States, tool and die makers who graduate from NTMA have gone through 4 years of college courses as well as 10,000 working hours in order to complete their apprenticeship.",1
"A moldmaker or molder is a skilled tradesperson who fabricates moulds for use in casting metal products.Moldmakers are generally employed in foundries, where molds are used to cast products from metals such as aluminium and cast iron.",1
A welder is a tradesperson who specializes in fusing materials together.,1
"The term welder refers to the operator, the machine is referred to as the welding power supply.",1
"Welders typically have to have good dexterity and attention to detail, as well as technical knowledge about the materials being joined and best practices in the field.",1
"To prevent them, welders wear personal protective equipment in the form of heavy leather gloves and protective long sleeve jackets to avoid exposure to extreme heat and flames.",1
"Welders with expertise in welding pressurized vessels, including submarine hulls, industrial boilers, and power plant heat exchangers and boilers, are generally referred to as boilermakers.A lot of welders relate to getting small electrical shocks from their equipment.",1
"Occasionally, welders might work in damp crowded environments and they consider it to be a ""part of the job.""",1
"Welders can be shocked by faulty conditions in the welding circuit, or, from the work lead clamp, a grounded power tool that is on the bench.",1
"When a welder feels a shock, they should take a minute to inspect the welding cables and ensure that they are clean and dry, and, that there are no cracks or gouges out of the rubber casing around the wire.",1
"A boilermaker is a tradesperson who fabricates steel, iron, or copper into boilers and other large containers intended to hold hot gas or liquid, as well as maintains and repairs boilers and boiler systems.Although the name originated from craftsmen who made boilers, boilermakers in fact assemble, maintain, and repair other large vessels and closed vats.",1
"The boilermaker trade evolved from industrial blacksmithing; in the early nineteenth century, a boilermaker was called a boilersmith.",1
The involvement of boilermakers in the shipbuilding and engineering industries came about because of the changeover from wood to iron as a construction material.,1
Other boilermakers might work seasonally or on an individual project such as re-fitting a boiler in a seagoing vessel or remodeling a steam plant.,1
"The two main responsibilities of boilermakers are the use of oxy-acetylene gas torch sets to cut or gouge steel plate and tubes, followed by gas tungsten arc welding, shielded metal arc welding, or gas metal arc welding to attach and mend the cut sections of tubes and steel plates.",1
"A pipefitter or steamfitter is a tradesperson who installs, assembles, fabricates, maintains and repairs mechanical piping systems.",1
Pipefitters usually begin as helpers or apprentices.,1
Journeyman pipefitters deal with industrial/commercial/marine piping and heating/cooling systems.,1
"Pipefitter apprenticeships are controlled and regulated provincially, and in some cases allow for advance standing in similar trades upon completion.",1
Union pipefitters are required to pass an apprenticeship test before becoming a licensed journeyman.,1
"Pipefitters are employed in the maintenance departments of power stations, refineries, offshore installations, factories and similar establishments, by pipefitting contractors.",1
"A gunsmith is a person who repairs, modifies, designs, or builds guns.",1
"Gunsmiths do modifications and changes to a firearm that may require a very high level of craftsmanship, requiring the skills of a top-level machinist, a very skilled wood worker, and even an engineer.",1
Gunsmiths also do factory level repairs and renovations to restore a much used or deteriorated firearms to new condition.,1
"Gunsmiths may also renew metal finishes to new condition levels or apply carvings, engravings, and other decorative features to an otherwise-finished gun.",1
"Alternatively, some gunsmiths learn many of the skills of the trade, but only apply them to a few weapon types (e.g.",1
Gunsmiths use their in-depth knowledge of guns to guide these inspections: either repairing deficiencies; or notifying customers of unsafe conditions and taking steps to prevent catastrophic failures.,1
"Some of the conditions a Gunsmith looks for when inspecting a firearm brought to them for repairs are:

Improper Assembly
Missing Parts
Cracks: all cracked parts are cause for concern, but especially so in the chamber-area, bolt, bolt-lugs, or buttstock.",1
"Gunsmiths specializing in custom areas can be called upon by professional target-shooters, avid sports shooters, or anyone that wants custom attributes added to their firearm to create highly accurate or custom looking firearms.",1
A Custom Gunsmith also builds high-end firearms for hunters and shooters with needs and desires that cannot be served by standard catalogued firearms offered by gun manufacturers.,1
Some highly specialized gunsmiths can complete all firearm modifications without anyone else in the industry helping them.,1
These highly gunsmithed rifles and pistols are derived from standard service models and are used in target shooting and combat marksmanship roles.,1
"Apprenticeships, learning directly from professional gunsmiths:
The National Rifle Association offers short courses in many common tasks and skills of professional gunsmithing.",1
"The practice of gunsmithing is therefore typically restricted, licensed or regulated.",1
"Where the gunsmith frequently has to design, manufacture and fit parts ranging from small internal parts and assemblies, the armorer usually only has to replace standard interchangeable parts belonging to only one type, series, or family of military-related firearms.",1
Gunsmithing in these regions is concerned with the hand-crafting of completely custom-made firearms tailored to the requirements of the owner.,1
"But, as the gunsmith's patrons are usually well able to afford the high ownership fees and stringent storage requirements, the price of the arm is only secondary.",1
"The ATF requires all gunsmiths to record all repairs, noting the serial numbers, type of firearm, caliber or gauge, and full particulars of the owner, with an accepted form of Identification ID to be presented and recorded.",1
"Gunsmiths are required to maintain these records in a permanent, non-alterable form.",1
Gunsmiths who lack sophisticated machine shop capabilities must understand the law.,1

"Marquetry is the art and craft of applying pieces of veneer to a structure to form decorative patterns, designs or pictures.",1
"Marquetry differs from the more ancient craft of inlay, or intarsia, in which a solid body of one material is cut out to receive sections of another to form the surface pattern.",1
Marquetry using colored straw was a specialty of some European spa resorts from the end of the 18th century.,1
"The simplest kind of marquetry uses only two sheets of veneer, which are temporarily glued together and cut with a fine saw, producing two contrasting panels of identical design,.",1
Marquetry as a modern craft most commonly uses knife-cut veneers.,1
"Marquetry elaborated upon Florentine techniques of inlaying solid marble slabs with designs formed of fitted marbles, jaspers and semi-precious stones.",1
Techniques of wood marquetry were developed in Antwerp and other Flemish centers of luxury cabinet-making during the early 16th century.,1
"Early masters of French marquetry were the Fleming Pierre Golle and his son-in-law, André-Charles Boulle, who founded a dynasty of royal and Parisian cabinet-makers and gave his name to a technique of marquetry employing tortoiseshell and brass with pewter in arabesque or intricately foliate designs.",1
"Boulle marquetry dropped out of favor in the 1720s, but was revived in the 1780s.",1
"Floral marquetry came into favor in Parisian furniture in the 1750s, employed by cabinet-makers like Bernard van Risenbergh, Jean-Pierre Latz and Simon-François Oeben.",1
Marquetry was not ordinarily a feature of furniture made outside large urban centers.,1
"Nevertheless, marquetry was introduced into London furniture at the Restoration of Charles II in 1660, the product of immigrant Dutch 'inlayers', whose craft traditions owed a lot to Antwerp.",1
"Panels of elaborately scrolling ""seaweed"" marquetry of box or holly contrasting with walnut appeared on table tops, cabinets, and long-case clocks.",1
"Marquetry was revived as a vehicle of Neoclassicism and a 'French taste' in London furniture, starting in the late 1760s.",1
"Cabinet-makers associated with London-made marquetry furniture, 1765–1790, include Thomas Chippendale and less familiar names, like John Linnell, the French craftsman Pierre Langlois, and the firm of William Ince and John Mayhew.",1
"Although marquetry is a technique separate from inlay, English marquetry-makers were called ""inlayers"" throughout the 18th century.",1
Marquetry was a feature of some centers of German cabinet-making from c. 1710.,1
"Marquetry was not a mainstream fashion in 18th-century Italy, but the neoclassical marquetry of Giuseppe Maggiolini, made in Milan at the end of the century is notable.",1
"Arguably this is no longer marquetry in the pure sense, since it spills over into textured painting, even collage to some extent.",1
"A farrier is a specialist in equine hoof care, including the trimming and balancing of horses' hooves and the placing of shoes on their hooves, if necessary.",1
A farrier combines some blacksmith's skills with some veterinarian's skills to care for horses' feet.,1
"A farrier's work in colonial America or pre-Industrial Revolution Europe would have included shoeing horses, as well as the fabrication and repair of tools, the forging of architectural pieces, and so on.",1
"Modern-day farriers usually specialize in horseshoeing, focusing their time and effort on the care of the horse's hoof.",1
"For this reason, farriers and blacksmiths are considered to be in separate, albeit related, trades.",1
"There is also a farrier on call ""round the clock, twenty-four hours a day, at Hyde Park Barracks"".In the United Kingdom, the Worshipful Company of Farriers is one of the Livery Companies of the City of London.",1
"The Farriers, or horseshoe makers, organised in 1356.",1
"Additional tasks for the farrier include dealing with injured or diseased hooves and application of special shoes for racing, training, or ""cosmetic"" purposes.",1
"The farrier examinations for these organizations are designed so that qualified farriers may obtain a formal credential indicating they meet a meaningful standard of professional competence as determined by technical knowledge and practical skills examinations, length of field experience, and other factors.",1
Farriers who have received a certificate of completion for attending a farrier school or course may represent themselves as having completed a particular course of study.,1
"For instance, farriers voluntarily registered with the American Association of Professional Farriers  require at least 16 hours of continuing education every year to maintain their accreditation.",1
"Furniture refers to movable objects intended to support various human activities such as seating, eating, and sleeping.",1
"Furniture is also used to hold objects at a convenient height for work, or to store things.",1
Furniture can be a product of design and is considered a form of decorative art.,1
"In addition to furniture's functional role, it can serve a symbolic or religious purpose.",1
Furniture can be made using a variety of woodworking joints which often reflect the local culture.,1
"Early furniture from this period is known from artwork such as a Venus figurine found in Russia, depicting the goddess on a throne.",1
"The first surviving extant furniture is in the homes of Skara Brae in Scotland, and includes cupboards, dressers and beds all constructed from stone.",1
"The evolution of furniture design continued in ancient Greece and ancient Rome, with thrones being commonplace as well as the klinai, multipurpose couches used for relaxing, eating, and sleeping.",1
"The furniture of the Middle Ages was usually heavy, oak, and ornamented.",1
Furniture design expanded during the Italian Renaissance of the fourteenth and fifteenth century.,1
One unique outgrowth of post-modern furniture design is a return to natural shapes and textures.,1
"Ancient furniture has been excavated from the 8th-century BCE Phrygian tumulus, the Midas Mound, in Gordion, Turkey.",1
"Evidence of furniture from the predynastic period is scarce, but samples from First Dynasty tombs indicate an already advanced use of furnishings in the houses of the age.During the dynastic period, which began in around 3200 BCE, Egyptian art developed significantly, and this included furniture design.",1
"Egyptian furniture was primarily constructed using wood, but other materials were sometimes used, such as leather, and pieces were often adorned with gold, silver, ivory and ebony, for decoration.",1
"Other furniture types in ancient Egypt include tables, which are heavily represented in art, but almost nonexistent as preserved items – perhaps because they were placed outside tombs rather than within, as well as beds and storage chests.",1
Greek furniture construction also made use of dowels and tenons for joining the wooden parts of a piece together.,1
"Very little wooden furniture survives intact, but there is evidence that a variety of woods were used, including maple, citron, beech, oak, and holly.",1
"Starting in the eighteenth century, furniture designs began to develop more rapidly.",1
"Prime examples include furniture designed by George Nelson Associates, Charles and Ray Eames, Paul McCobb, Florence Knoll, Harry Bertoia, Eero Saarinen, Harvey Probber, Vladamir Kagan and Danish modern designers including Finn Juhl and Arne Jacobsen.",1
Transitional furniture is intended to fill a place between Traditional and Modern tastes.,1
This new line of furniture is based on environmentally friendly design.,1
"Traditional Japanese furniture is well known for its minimalist style, extensive use of wood, high-quality craftsmanship and reliance on wood grain instead of painting or thick lacquer.",1
"Most commonly, quality furniture is made out of hardwood which is made from oak, maple, mahogany, teak, walnut, cherry and birch.",1

"Industries employing laborers include building things such as roads, buildings, bridges, tunnels, and railway tracks.",1
"Laborers work with blasting tools, hand tools, power tools, air tools, and small heavy equipment, and act as assistants to other trades as well  such as operators or cement masons.",1
"However, unlike engineers, laborers are not usually employed full-time year-round and face significant hazards.",1
The additional pay laborers receive is often balanced out by the lesser unemployment checks they receive while out of work and the disability checks they receive while injured—often debilitated for life.,1
"In construction, the pay for laborers is low enough that planning problems can be solved by ""throwing laborers at it.""",1
Union laborer often earn more than nonunion and can be an avenue for those who are uneducated and with no resources to become educated and with resources.,1
Many laborers are severely injured or killed in accidents each year while performing work duties.,1
"Many who work as laborers for even a short period of time will suffer from permanent work injuries such as: hearing loss, arthritis, osteoarthritis, back injuries, eye injury, head injury, chemical burn, lung disease, missing fingernails and skin scars.",1
If a laborer is injured on the job they are immediately given a drug test.,1
"Automation, or Labor-saving technology is the technology by which a process or procedure is performed with minimal human assistance.",1

"Automation covers applications ranging from a household thermostat controlling a boiler, to a large industrial control system with tens of thousands of input measurements and output control signals.",1
"Automation has been achieved by various means including mechanical, hydraulic, pneumatic, electrical, electronic devices and computers, usually in combination.",1
"The benefit of automation includes labor savings, savings in electricity costs, savings in material costs, and improvements to quality, accuracy, and precision.",1
"The advanced type of automation that revolutionized manufacturing, aircraft, communications, and other industries, is feedback control, which is usually continuous and involves taking measurements using a sensor and making calculated adjustments to keep the measured variable within a set range.",1
The theoretical basis of closed-loop automation is control theory.,1
Before automation many chemicals were made in batches.,1
Today extensive automation is practiced in practically every type of manufacturing and assembly process.,1
"Many operations using automation have large amounts of invested capital and produce high volumes of product, making malfunctions extremely costly and potentially hazardous.",1
"Its primary concern is the automation of clerical tasks and workflows that consist of structuring unstructured data.Cognitive automation relies on multiple disciplines: natural language processing, real-time computing, machine learning algorithms, big data analytics, and evidence-based learning.",1
"In addition, automation and online shopping could reduce demands for shopping malls, and retail property, which in America is currently estimated to account for 31% of all commercial property or around 7 billion square feet.",1
"Other forms of automation can also be an integral part of online shopping, for example, the deployment of automated warehouse robotics such as that applied by Amazon using Kiva Systems.",1
"Full automation commonly defined as requiring no control or very limited control by the driver; such automation would be accomplished through a combination of sensor, computer, and communications systems in vehicles and along the roadway.",1
Robotic process automation is an emerging field within BPA and uses artificial intelligence.,1
"Therefore, automation has been extensively employed in laboratories.",1
"However, automation has not become widespread in laboratories due to its high cost.",1
Industrial automation is to replace the decision making of humans and manual command-response activities with the use of mechanized equipment and logical programming commands.,1
Industrial automation is simply required in industries.,1
Desktop automation refers to software programming that makes it easier for the call center agent to work across multiple desktop tools.,1
"The automation would take the information entered into one tool and populate it across the others so it did not have to be entered more than once, for example.",1
"The use of automation ensures that what is supposed to happen on the call actually does, every time.",1
"However, automation is expected to triple or quadruple leading these numbers to become substantially higher.Based on a formula by Gilles Saint-Paul, an economist at Toulouse 1 University, the demand for unskilled human capital declines at a slower rate than the demand for skilled human capital increases.",1
"Polishing is the process of creating a smooth and shiny surface by rubbing it or using a chemical action, leaving a surface with a significant specular reflection",1
"In some materials, polishing  is also able to reduce diffuse reflection to minimal values.",1
The process of polishing with abrasives starts with coarse ones and graduates to fine ones.,1
A heavy equipment operator operates heavy equipment used in engineering and construction projects.,1
Warehouses needed more maneuverable forklift trucks that could reach greater heights and new forklift models were made that filled this need.,1
Forklift trucks are available in many variations and load capacities.,1
This forklift truck has also made an appearance in the TV series called 'Mythbusters'.,1
"However, only the forklift truck manufacturer can give accurate lifting capacities.",1
"Management is the administration of an organization, whether it is a business, a not-for-profit organization, or government body.",1
"Management includes the activities of setting the strategy of an organization and coordinating the efforts of its employees to accomplish its  objectives through the application of available resources, such as financial, natural, technological, and human resources.",1
"The term ""management"" may also refer to those people who manage an organization - individually: managers.",1

"Fredmund Malik defines management as ""the transformation of resources into utility"".",1
"Management is included as one of the factors of production – along with machines, materials and money.",1
"Ghislain Deslandes defines management as ""a vulnerable force, under pressure to achieve results and endowed with the triple power of constraint, imitation and imagination, operating on subjective, interpersonal, institutional and environmental levels"".",1
"As such, management is not the manipulation of a mechanism, not the herding of animals, and can occur either in a legal or in an illegal enterprise or environment.",1
"From an individual's perspective, management does not need to be seen solely from an enterprise point of view, because management is an essential function in improving one's life and relationships.",1
Management is therefore everywhere and it has a wider range of application.,1
"Based on this, management must have humans.",1
"At first, one views management functionally, such as measuring quantity, adjusting plans, meeting goals.",1
"From this perspective, Henri Fayol
considers management to consist of five functions:

planning
organizing
commanding
coordinating
controllingIn another way of thinking, Mary Parker Follett, allegedly defined management as ""the art of getting things done through people"".",1
"She described management as philosophy.Critics, however, find this definition useful but far too narrow.",1
"The phrase ""management is what managers do"" occurs widely,
suggesting the difficulty of defining management without circularity, the shifting nature of definitions and the connection of managerial practices with the existence of a  managerial cadre or of a  class.",1
"One habit of thought regards management as equivalent to ""business administration"" and thus excludes management in places outside commerce, as for example in charities and in the public sector.",1
"Management on the whole is the process of planning, organizing, coordinating, leading
and controlling.",1
"In nonprofit management, add the importance of keeping the faith of donors.",1
"In most models of management and governance, shareholders vote for the board of directors, and the board then hires senior management.",1
"Others, however, detect management-like thought among ancient Sumerian traders and the builders of the pyramids of ancient Egypt.",1
Many of these aspects of management existed in the pre-1861 slave-based sector of the US economy.,1
The first comprehensive theories of management appeared around 1920.,1
"Operations research, sometimes known as ""management science"", attempts to take a scientific approach to solving decision-problems, and can apply directly to multiple management problems, particularly in the areas of logistics and operations.",1
In this context many management fads may have had more to do with pop psychology than with scientific theories of management.,1
"Further, management programs related to civil-society organizations have also spawned programs in nonprofit management and social entrepreneurship.",1
"All management embraces to some degree a democratic principle—in that in the long term, the majority of workers must support management.",1
"In some cases, management has even rewarded itself with bonuses after laying off lower-level workers.According to leadership-academic Manfred F.R.",1
"Kets de Vries, a contemporary senior-management team will almost inevitably have some personality disorders.",1
Mid and lower-level management may add their own plans to the business's strategies.,1
"Some members of the senior management may serve as the public face of the organization, and they may make speeches to introduce new strategies or appear in marketing.",1
"Helpful skills of top management vary by the type of organization but typically include a broad understanding of competition, world economies, and politics.",1
"Executive management accomplishes the day-to-day details, including: instructions for preparation of department budgets, procedures, schedules; appointment of middle level executives such as department managers; coordination of departments; media and governmental relations; and shareholder communication.",1

Evidence-based management entails managerial decisions and organizational practices informed by the best available evidence.,1
"Quality assurance is a way of preventing mistakes and defects in manufactured products and avoiding problems when delivering products or services to customers; which ISO 9000 defines as ""part of quality management focused on providing confidence that quality requirements will be fulfilled"".",1
"This defect prevention in quality assurance differs subtly from defect detection and rejection in quality control and has been referred to as a shift left since it focuses on quality earlier in the process.The terms ""quality assurance"" and ""quality control"" are often used interchangeably to refer to ways of ensuring the quality of a service or product.",1
"Quality assurance includes two principles: ""Fit for purpose""; and ""right first time"".",1
"This led to quality assurance or total quality control, which has come into being recently.",1
Quality assurance is seen as one part of product assurance.,1

A surprise inspection tends to have different results than an announced inspection.,1
"If an inspection is made known in advance, it can give people a chance to cover up or to fix mistakes.",1
"A surprise inspection, therefore, gives inspectors a better picture of the typical state of the inspected object or process than an announced inspection.",1
"Inspection in manufacturing includes measuring, examining, testing, or gauging one or more characteristics of a product or process and comparing the results with specified requirements to determine whether is the requirements are met for each characteristic.",1
"Common examples of inspection by measurement or gauging include using a caliper or micrometer to determine if a dimension of a manufactured part is within the dimensional tolerance specified in a drawing for that part, and is thus acceptable for use.",1
Design for Inspection is a concept that should complement and work in collaboration with Design for Manufacturability and Design for Assembly to reduce product manufacturing cost and increase manufacturing practicality.,1
Commodity inspection is other term that is used between buyers and sellers.,1
Some buyers hire the inspection agencies only for pre-shipment inspections i.e.,1
Normally inspection is done based on an agreed inspection and test plan.,1
Inspections are used for the purpose of determining if a body is complying with regulations.,1
The Food Safety Inspection Service is charged with ensuring that all meat and egg products in the United States are safe to consume and accurately labeled.,1

"Statistics deals with every aspect of data, including the planning of data collection in terms of the design of surveys and experiments.",1
See glossary of probability and statistics.,1
"Descriptive statistics are most often concerned with two sets of properties of a distribution: central tendency seeks to characterize the distribution's central or typical value, while dispersion characterizes the extent to which members of the distribution depart from its center and each other.",1
"Inferences on mathematical statistics are made under the framework of probability theory, which deals with the analysis of random phenomena.",1
"In the 18th century, statistics also started to draw heavily from calculus.",1
In more recent years statistics has relied more on statistical software to produce these tests such as descriptive analysis.,1
Some consider statistics to be a distinct mathematical science rather than a branch of mathematics.,1
Descriptive statistics can be used to summarize the population data.,1
"Again, descriptive statistics can be used to summarize the sample data.",1

The modern field of statistics emerged in the late 19th and early 20th century in three stages.,1
Statistics continues to be an area of active research for example on the problem of how to analyze big data.,1
Statistics itself also provides tools for prediction and forecasting through statistical models.,1
Statistics offers methods to estimate and correct for any bias within the sample and data collection procedures.,1
"Probability is used in mathematical statistics to study the sampling distributions of sample statistics and, more generally, the properties of statistical procedures.",1
"Descriptive statistics is distinguished from inferential statistics, in that descriptive statistics aims to summarize a sample, rather than use the data to learn about the population that the sample of data is thought to represent.",1
Inferential statistics can be contrasted with descriptive statistics.,1
"Descriptive statistics is solely concerned with properties of the observed data, and it does not rest on the assumption that the data come from a larger population.",1
"As everything in inferential statistics it relies on sample size, and therefore under fat tails p-values may be seriously mis-computed.",1

"Industrial engineering is an engineering profession that is concerned with the optimization of complex processes, systems, or organizations by developing, improving and implementing integrated systems of people, money, knowledge, information, equipment, energy and materials.Industrial engineers use specialized knowledge and skills in the mathematical, physical and social sciences, together with the principles and methods of engineering analysis and design, to specify, predict, and evaluate the results obtained from systems and processes.",1
"Depending on the sub-specialties involved, industrial engineering may also overlap with, operations research, systems engineering, manufacturing engineering, production engineering, supply chain engineering, management science, management engineering, financial engineering, ergonomics or human factors engineering, safety engineering, or others, depending on the viewpoint or motives of the user.",1
The first doctoral degree in industrial engineering was awarded in 1933 by Cornell University.,1
The American Institute of Industrial Engineering was formed in 1948.,1
"Also, Industrial engineering considers the human factor and its relation to the technical aspect of the situation and the all of the other factors that influence the entire situation, while other engineering disciplines focus on the design of inanimate objects.",1
"""""Industrial Engineering is the branch of Engineering most closely related to human resources in that we apply social skills to work with all types of employees, from engineers to salespeople to top management.",1
"Industrial Engineering is different in that it is based on discrete variable math, whereas all other engineering is based on continuous variable math.",1
"In fact, the ""Industrial"" in Industrial engineering means the ""industry"" in its broadest sense.",1
"Industrial engineering elective courses typically cover more specialized topics in areas such as manufacturing, supply chains and logistics, analytics and machine learning, production systems, human factors and industrial design, and service systems.Certain business schools may offer programs with some overlapping relevance to IE, but the engineering programs are distinguished by a much more intensely quantitative focus, required engineering science electives, and the core math and science courses required of all engineering programs.",1
"Examples of where industrial engineering might be used include flow process charting, process mapping, designing an assembly workstation, strategizing for various operational logistics, consulting as an efficiency expert, developing a new financial algorithm or loan system for a bank, streamlining operation and emergency room location or usage in a hospital, planning complex distribution schemes for materials or products, and shortening lines at a bank, hospital, or a theme park.",1

"Metallurgy is a domain of materials science and engineering that studies the physical and chemical behavior of metallic elements, their inter-metallic compounds, and their mixtures, which are called alloys.",1
Metallurgy encompasses both the science and the technology of metals.,1
Metallurgy is distinct from the craft of metalworking.,1
Metalworking relies on metallurgy in a similar manner to how medicine relies on medical science for technical advancement.,1
A specialist practitioner of metallurgy is known as a Metallurgist.,1
The science of metallurgy is subdivided into two broad categories: chemical metallurgy and physical metallurgy.,1
"Chemical metallurgy is chiefly concerned with the reduction and oxidation of metals, and the chemical performance of metals.",1
"Subjects of study in chemical metallurgy include mineral processing, the extraction of metals, thermodynamics, electrochemistry, and chemical degradation.",1
"In contrast, physical metallurgy focuses on the mechanical properties of metals, the physical properties of metals, and the physical performance of metals.",1
"Topics studied in physical metallurgy include crystallography, material characterization, mechanical metallurgy, phase transformations, and failure mechanisms.Historically, metallurgy has predominately focused on the production of metals.",1
Ferrous metallurgy involves processes and alloys based on iron while non-ferrous metallurgy involves processes and alloys based on other metals.,1
"Early metallurgy is also documented at the nearby site of Tell Maghzaliyah, which seems to be dated even earlier, and completely lacks that pottery.",1
"The interdisciplinary field of materials science, also commonly termed materials science and engineering, is the design and discovery of new materials, particularly solids.",1
"The intellectual origins of materials science stem from the Enlightenment, when researchers began to use analytical thinking from chemistry, physics, and engineering to understand ancient, phenomenological observations in metallurgy and mineralogy.",1
"Materials science still incorporates elements of physics, chemistry, and engineering.",1
"Beginning in the 1940s, materials science began to be more widely recognized as a specific and distinct field of science and engineering, and major technical universities around the world created dedicated schools for its study.",1
"Materials science is a syncretic discipline hybridizing metallurgy, ceramics, solid-state physics, and chemistry.",1
"Thus, breakthroughs in materials science are likely to affect the future of technology significantly.Materials scientists emphasize understanding how the history of a material influences its structure, and thus the material's properties and performance.",1
"Materials science is also an important part of forensic engineering and failure analysis –  investigating materials, products, structures or components which fail or do not function as intended, causing personal injury or damage to property.",1
"Modern materials science evolved directly from metallurgy, which itself evolved from mining and ceramics and earlier from the use of fire.",1
"Important elements of modern materials science were products of the Space Race: the understanding and engineering of the metallic alloys, and silica and carbon materials, used in building space vehicles enabling the exploration of space.",1
"Materials science has driven, and been driven by, the development of revolutionary technologies such as rubbers, plastics, semiconductors, and biomaterials.",1
"Before the 1960s, many eventual materials science departments were metallurgy or ceramics engineering departments, reflecting the 19th and early 20th century emphasis on metals and ceramics.",1
"The growth of materials science in the United States was catalyzed in part by the Advanced Research Projects Agency, which funded a series of university-hosted laboratories in the early 1960s ""to expand the national program of basic research and training in the materials sciences.""",1
"The prominent change in materials science during the recent decades is active usage of computer simulations to find new materials, predict properties, and understand phenomena.",1
"The basis of materials science involves studying the structure of materials, and relating them to their properties.",1
"Materials science examines the structure of materials from the atomic scale, all the way up to the macro scale.",1
"When applied to materials science, it deals with how a material changes with time due to application of a certain field.",1
"Together with materials science departments, physics, chemistry, and many engineering departments are involved in materials research.",1
"Nanomaterials research takes a materials science-based approach to nanotechnology, using advances in materials metrology and synthesis which have been developed in support of microfabrication research.",1
"Biomaterials science encompasses elements of medicine, biology, chemistry, tissue engineering, and materials science.",1
"Industrial applications of materials science include materials design, cost-benefit tradeoffs in industrial production of materials, processing methods (casting, rolling, welding, ion implantation, crystal growth, thin-film deposition, sintering, glassblowing, etc.",1
Another application of materials science in industry is making composite materials.,1
"Thus, materials science and engineering emerged in many ways: renaming and/or combining existing metallurgy and ceramics engineering departments; splitting from existing solid state physics research; pulling in relatively new polymer engineering and polymer science; recombining from the previous, as well as chemistry, chemical engineering, mechanical engineering, and electrical engineering; and more.",1
"The field of materials science and engineering is important both from a scientific perspective, as well as from an engineering one.",1
Materials science also provides a test for theories in condensed matter physics.,1
"As a result, materials science is an increasingly important part of an engineer's education.",1
Materials Science and Engineering – An Introduction.,1
Chambers Dictionary of Materials Science and Technology.,1
"A surface plate is a solid, flat plate used as the main horizontal reference plane for precision inspection, marking out, and tooling setup.",1
"The surface plate is often used as the baseline for all measurements to a workpiece, therefore one primary surface is finished extremely flat with tolerances below 11.5 μm or 0.0115 mm per 2960 mm for a grade 0 plate.",1
"Surface plates are a common tool in the manufacturing industry and are often fitted with mounting points so that it can be an integrated structural element of a machine such as a coordinate-measuring machine, precision optical assembly, or other high precision scientific & industrial machine.",1
"Surface plates must be calibrated regularly to ensure that chipping, warping, or wear has not occurred.",1
The importance of the high-precision surface plate was first recognised by Henry Maudslay around 1800.,1
"Today most surface plates continue to be made of black granite, more accurately referred to as black diabase, with the more wear-resistant surface plates being made of quartz-bearing granite.",1
Damage to a granite surface plate will usually result in a chip but does not affect the accuracy of the overall plane.,1
Cast-iron surface plates are now frequently used on production floors as a tool for lapping granite surface plates to achieve certain grades of accuracy.,1
"These specialized surface plates are produced in sets of three, by the company that will be using them, so the plates may be regularly verified and refined without the need to send them out to be reconditioned.",1
Granite surface plate calibration also includes cleaning and a light polishing.,1
"A height gauge is a measuring device used for determining the height of objects, and for marking of items to be worked on.",1
Height gauges may also be used to measure the height of an object by using the underside of the scriber as the datum.,1
"A micrometer, sometimes known as a micrometer screw gauge, is a device incorporating a calibrated screw widely used for accurate measurement of components in mechanical engineering and machining as well as most mechanical trades, along with other metrological instruments such as dial, vernier, and digital calipers.",1
"Micrometers are usually, but not always, in the form of calipers.",1
Micrometers are also used in telescopes or microscopes to measure the apparent diameter of celestial bodies or microscopic objects.,1
"The micrometer used with a telescope was invented about 1638 by  William Gascoigne, an English astronomer.",1
"Henry Maudslay built a bench micrometer in the early 19th century that was jocularly nicknamed ""the Lord Chancellor"" among his staff because it was the final judge on measurement accuracy and precision in the firm's work.",1
"(Those languages also use the micrometer cognates: micromètre, micrómetro, micrometro.)",1
"The micrometer caliper was introduced to the mass market in anglophone countries by Brown & Sharpe in 1867, allowing the penetration of the instrument's use into the average machine shop.",1
"Universal micrometer sets come with interchangeable anvils, such as flat, spherical, spline, disk, blade, point, and knife-edge.",1
"The term universal micrometer may also refer to a type of micrometer whose frame has modular components, allowing one micrometer to function as outside mic, depth mic, step mic, etc.",1
Blade micrometers have a matching set of narrow tips.,1
Pitch-diameter micrometers have a matching set of thread-shaped tips for measuring the pitch diameter of screw threads.,1
"Bore micrometer, typically a three-anvil head on a micrometer base used to accurately measure inside diameters.",1
Tube micrometers have a cylindrical anvil positioned perpendicularly to a spindle and is used to measure the thickness of tubes.,1
"Micrometer stops are micrometer heads that are mounted on the table of a manual milling machine, bedways of a lathe, or other machine tool, in place of simple stops.",1
Ball micrometers with a pair of balls can be used when single-tangential-point contact is desired on both sides.,1
Bench micrometers are tools for inspection use whose accuracy and precision are around half a micrometre and whose repeatability is around a quarter micrometre.,1
The accuracy of a micrometer derives from the accuracy of the thread-forms that are central to the core of its design.,1
"In some micrometers, even greater accuracy is obtained by using a differential screw adjuster to move the thimble in much smaller increments than a single thread would allow.In classic-style analog micrometers, the position of the thimble is read directly from scale markings on the thimble and sleeve.",1
"In digital micrometers, an electronic readout displays the length digitally on an LCD on the instrument.",1
For micrometers this is their typical accuracy range.Micrometers typically have a specified temperature at which the measurement is correct.,1
The additional digit of these micrometers is obtained by finding the line on the sleeve vernier scale which exactly coincides with one on the thimble.,1
"Thus, the reading for metric micrometers of this type is the number of whole millimeters  and the number of hundredths of a millimeter, as with an ordinary micrometer, and the number of thousandths of a millimeter given by the coinciding vernier line on the sleeve vernier scale.",1
Inch micrometers are read in a similar fashion.,1
"Therefore, metric micrometers provide smaller measuring increments than comparable inch unit micrometers—the smallest graduation of an ordinary inch reading micrometer is 0.001 inch; the vernier type has graduations down to 0.0001 inch.",1
A useful feature of many micrometers is the inclusion of a torque-limiting device on the thimble—either a spring-loaded ratchet or a friction sleeve.,1
"Bench micrometers of the ""super-mic"" class entirely obviate this interuser variation by having the user dial the handwheel until a needle reads zero on a gauge, producing the same pressure on every reading.",1
"If the micrometer measures 0.7503 inch, then it is out of calibration.",1
"If the micrometer is in good condition, then they are all so near to zero that the instrument seems to read essentially ""-on"" all along its range; no noticeable error is seen at any locale.",1
"In contrast, on a worn-out micrometer, one can ""chase the error up and down the range"", that is, move it up or down to any of various locales along the range, by adjusting the sleeve, but one cannot eliminate it from all locales at once.",1
"A micrometer can be calibrated on-site anytime, at least in the most basic and important way, by measuring a high-grade gauge block and adjusting to match.",1
Geometric dimensioning and tolerancing is a system for defining and communicating engineering tolerances.,1
An engineering drawing is a type of technical drawing that is used to convey information about an object.,1
The process of producing engineering drawings is often referred to as technical drawing or drafting.,1
"Modern engineering drawing, with its precise conventions of orthographic projection and scale, arose in France at a time when the Industrial Revolution was in its infancy.",1
One major set of engineering drawing standards is ASME Y14.5 and Y14.5M.,1
"Today most engineering drawing is done with CAD, but pencil and paper have not entirely disappeared.",1
Engineering drawings could be readily doubled in size and put on the next larger size of paper with no waste of space.,1
"Engineering drawings use a Gothic sans-serif script, formed by a series of short strokes.",1

"A miner is a person who extracts ore, coal, or other mineral from the earth through mining.",1
"In its narrowest sense, a miner is someone who works at the rock face; cutting, blasting, or otherwise working and removing the rock.",1
"In a broader sense, a ""miner"" is anyone working within a mine, not just a worker at the rock face.Mining is one of the most dangerous trades in the world.",1
"In some countries, miners lack social guarantees and in case of injury may be left to cope without assistance.",1
"Roles considered to be ""miners"" in the narrower sense have included:

Hewer, whose job was to hew the rock.",1
"Because technology is constantly changing, miners and mining engineers need to continue their education.",1
"Scrap consists of recyclable materials left over from product manufacturing and consumption, such as parts of vehicles, building supplies, and surplus materials.",1
"Unlike waste, scrap has monetary value, especially recovered metals, and non-metallic materials are also recovered for recycling.",1
"Typically a ""scrapper"" will advertise their services to conveniently remove scrap metal for people who don't need it.",1
"Scrap is often taken to a wrecking yard, where it is processed for later melting into new products.",1
Many scrapyards also sell bulk metals,1
A scrap metal shredder is often used to recycle items containing a variety of other materials in combination with steel.,1
"In contrast to wrecking yards, scrapyards typically sell everything by weight, instead of by item.",1
"To the scrapyard, the primary value of the scrap is what the smelter will give them for it, rather than the value of whatever shape the metal may be in.",1
Some scrap yards' websites have updated scrap prices.,1
"In the US, scrap prices are reported in a handful of publications, including American Metal Market, based on confirmed sales as well as reference sites such as Scrap Metal Prices and Auctions.",1
"Scrap yards directories are also used by recyclers to find facilities in the US and Canada, allowing users to get in contact with yards.",1
"Many specialized tools used in scrapyards are hazardous, such as the alligator shear, which cuts metal using hydraulic force, compactors, and scrap metal shredders.",1
"Using recycled scrap metal in place of virgin iron ore can yield:
75% savings in energy.",1
"Some of the scrap can be reheated and rolled to make products such as concrete reinforcing bars, or the scrap may be melted to make new steel.",1
Scrap recycling also helps reduce greenhouse gas emissions and conserves energy and natural resources.,1
"For example, scrap recycling diverts 135 million short tons of materials away from landfills.",1
"Recycled scrap is a raw material feedstock for nearly 60% of steel made in the US, for almost 50% of the copper and copper alloys produced in the US, for more than 75% of the US paper industry's needs, and for 50% of US aluminum.",1
Recycled scrap helps keep air and water cleaner by removing potentially hazardous materials and keeping them out of landfills.,1
"A trade union is an association of workers forming a legal unit or legal personhood, usually called a ""bargaining unit"", which acts as bargaining agent and legal representative for a unit of employees in all matters of law or right arising from or in the administration of a collective agreement.",1
"The trade union, through an elected leadership and bargaining committee, bargains with the employer on behalf of union members and negotiates labour contracts with employers.",1
Trade unions traditionally have a constitution which details the governance of their bargaining unit and also have governance at various levels of government depending on the industry that binds them legally to their negotiations and functioning.,1
"Originating in Great Britain, trade unions became popular in many countries during the Industrial Revolution.",1
"Trade unions may be composed of individual workers, professionals, past workers, students, apprentices or the unemployed.",1
"Trade union density, or the percentage of workers belonging to a trade union, is highest in the Nordic countries.",1
"Karl Marx described trade unions thus: ""The value of labour-power constitutes the conscious and explicit foundation of the trade unions, whose importance for the […] working class can scarcely be overestimated.",1
The trade unions aim at nothing less than to prevent the reduction of wages below the level that is traditionally maintained in the various branches of industry.,1
"Trade unions have sometimes been seen as successors to the guilds of medieval Europe, though the relationship between the two is disputed, as the masters of the guilds employed workers who were not allowed to organize.Trade unions and collective bargaining were outlawed from no later than the middle of the 14th century, when the Ordinance of Labourers was enacted in the Kingdom of England, but their way of thinking was the one that endured down the centuries, inspiring evolutions and advances in thinking which eventually gave workers their necessary rights.",1
"More permanent trade unions were established from the 1850s, better resourced but often less radical.",1
Trade union density around the world shows great variation.,1
"During the 1880s Trade unions developed among shearers, miners, and stevedores, but soon spread to cover almost all blue-collar jobs.",1
"After 1990 trade unions in the Baltic states have experienced rapid loss of membership and economic power, while employers’ organisations increased both power and membership.",1
"According to the International Trade Union Confederation there were 2832 murders of trade unionists between 1 January 1986 and 30 April 2010, meaning that ""on average, men and women trade unionists in Colombia have been killed at the rate of one every three days over the last 23 years.""",1
"One of the largest trade unions in Sweden is the Swedish Confederation of Trade Unions,, incorporating unions such as the Swedish Metal Workers' Union, the Swedish Electricians' Union and the Swedish Municipality Workers' Union.",1
"Trade unionism in the United Kingdom was a major factor in some of the economic crises during the 1960s and the 1970s, culminating in the ""Winter of Discontent"" of late 1978 and early 1979, when a significant percentage of the nation's public sector workers went on strike.",1
"The level of trade union membership also fell sharply in the 1980s, and continued falling for most of the 1990s.",1
Trade union density was 14.1% in the private sector and 56.5% in the public sector.,1
"In the United States, trade unions were formed based on power with the people, not over the people like the government at the time.",1
Typically such trade unions refrain from politics or pursue a more liberal politics than their blue-collar counterparts.,1
"In Poland, the biggest trade union Solidarity emerged as an anti-communist movement with religious nationalist overtones and today it supports the right-wing Law and Justice party.Although their political structure and autonomy varies widely, union leaderships are usually formed through democratic elections.",1
"In the United States, trade unions are almost always aligned with the Democratic Party with a few exceptions.",1
In Britain trade union movement's relationship with the Labour Party frayed as party leadership embarked on privatization plans at odds with what unions see as the worker's interests.,1
Other global trade union organizations include the World Federation of Trade Unions.,1
"National and regional trade unions organizing in specific industry sectors or occupational groups also form global union federations, such as Union Network International, the International Transport Workers Federation, the International Federation of Journalists, the International Arts and Entertainment Alliance or Public Services International.",1
"Thus, for instance, trade unions in both Nordic and southern European countries have devised collective bargaining agreements that improved the conditions of temporary agency workers.Several studies have found evidence that trade unions can reduce competitiveness due to a reduction of business profit, which can then lead to job losses as it makes the business unable to compete.",1

A truck driver  is a person who earns a living as the driver of a truck.,1
Truck drivers are also responsible for inspecting all their vehicles for mechanical items or issues relating to safe operation.,1
Truck drivers must complete a logbook documenting hours and kilometres spent driving.,1
"By 2009, truck drivers accounted for 16.8% of transportation-related deaths.",1
Truck drivers are five times more likely to die in a work-related accident than the average worker.,1
The safety of truck drivers and their trucks is monitored and statistics compiled by the FMCSA or Federal Motor Carriers Safety Administration who provides online information on safety violations.,1
This suggests that the truck driver makes the same errors as the car driver and vice versa.,1
"Truck drivers often spend their nights parked at a truck stop, rest area, or on the shoulder of a freeway ramp.",1
"Among other things, a truck driver's DAC Report contains the driver's identification, the name and address of the contributing trucking company, the driver's dates of employment with that company, the driver's reason for leaving that company, whether the driver is eligible for rehire, and comments about the driver's work record (e.g.",1
"As long as truck drivers can be threatened with a false DAC report for standing up to management or leaving their company for a better job elsewhere, working conditions at truck driver jobs will not improve.",1
The average age of a truck driver is now 57.During February 2016 an independent survey on the driver shortage was carried out by a UK freight exchange.,1
"Truck drivers are even a high-risk group for HIV-infection in those countries.In order to address the hazards relative to driver fatigue, many countries have laws limiting the amount of time truck drivers can work.",1
"Factors that increase truck driver fatigue include lack of sleep, long work hours, sedentary lifestyle, poor diet, and general stress.",1
A contributing factor to truck driver fatigue is the stress associated with managing compliance to FMCSA's hours of service regulations.,1
Truck drivers are required to keep a HOS-compliant log.,1
Almost 90% of truck drivers exercise only sometimes or never and only 8% exercise regularly.,1

"""Chemical engineering"", describing the use of mechanical equipment in the chemical industry, became common vocabulary in England after 1850.",1
"Courses in chemical engineering offered by Massachusetts Institute of Technology in the United States, Owens College in Manchester, England, and University College London suffered under similar circumstances.",1
"For instance, it defined chemical engineering to be a ""science of itself, the basis of which is ... unit operations"" in a 1922 report; and with which principle, it had published a list of academic institutions which offered ""satisfactory"" chemical engineering courses.",1
"Meanwhile, promoting chemical engineering as a distinct science in Britain led to the establishment of the Institution of Chemical Engineers in 1922.",1
"Developments in chemical engineering before and after World War II were mainly incited by the petrochemical industry, however, advances in other fields were made as well.",1

"Sewing is one of the oldest of the textile arts, arising in the Paleolithic era.",1
"The invention of the sewing machine in the 19th century and the rise of computerization in the 20th century led to mass production and export of sewn objects, but hand sewing is still practiced around the world.",1
"Fine hand sewing is a characteristic of high-quality tailoring, haute couture fashion, and custom dressmaking, and is pursued by both textile artists and hobbyists as a means of creative expression.The first known use of the word ""sewing"" was in the 14th century.",1
Sewing was used to stitch together animal hides for clothing and for shelter.,1
"Sewing was combined with the weaving of plant leaves in Africa to create baskets, such as those made by Zulu weavers, who used thin strips of palm leaf as ""thread"" to stitch wider strips of palm leaf that had been woven into a coil.",1
"The vital importance of sewing was indicated by the honorific position of ""Lord Sewer"" at many European coronations from the Middle Ages.",1
"Sewing for the most part was a woman's occupation, and most sewing before the 19th century was practical.",1
"However, there are instances of sewing techniques indigenous to cultures in distant locations from one another, where cross-cultural communication would have been historically unlikely.",1
The world's first sewing machine was patented in 1790 by Thomas Saint.,1
"Barthélemy Thimonnier introduced a simple sewing machine in 1841 to produce military uniforms for France's army; shortly afterward, a mob of tailors broke into Thimonnier's shop and threw the machines out of  the windows, believing the machines would put them out of work.",1
"As sewing machines became more affordable to the working class, demand for sewing patterns grew.",1
"Women's magazines also carried sewing patterns, and continued to do so for much of the 20th century.",1
The spread of sewing machine technology to industrialized economies around the world meant the spread of Western-style sewing methods and clothing styles as well.,1

A cordwainer is a shoemaker who makes new shoes from new leather.,1
"The cordwainer's trade can be contrasted with the cobbler's trade, according to a tradition in Britain that restricted cobblers to repairing shoes.",1
"In this usage, a cordwainer is someone who makes new shoes using new leather, whereas a cobbler is someone who repairs shoes.",1
"Medieval cordwainers used cordovan leather for the highest-quality shoes, but cordwainers also used domestically produced leathers and were not solely producers of luxury footwear.",1
"Historically, most of London's cordwainers lived and worked in the ward of the City of London named  Cordwainer.Until 2000 a Cordwainers' Technical College existed in London.",1
"In 2000 Cordwainers' College was absorbed into the London College of Fashion, the shoe-design and accessories departments of which have become ""Cordwainers at London College of Fashion"".",1
"In Scotland, in 1722, the cordwainers petitioned “to be incorporated and separated from the shoe-makers ""or those who make single-soled shoes"".",1
"A corset is a garment worn to hold and train the torso into a desired shape, traditionally a smaller waist or larger bottom, for aesthetic or medical purposes, or support the breasts.",1
"While these modern corsets and corset tops often feature lacing or boning, and generally imitate an historical style of corsets, they have very little, if any, effect on the shape of the wearer's body.",1
Genuine corsets are usually made by a corsetmaker and are frequently fitted to the individual wearer.,1
"The craft of corset construction is known as corsetry, as is the general wearing of them.",1
(The word corsetry is sometimes also used as a collective plural form of corset).,1
"Someone who makes corsets is a corsetier or corsetière, or sometimes simply a corsetmaker.",1
"In 1828, the word corset came into general use in the English language.",1
"However, in some periods, corsets have been worn to achieve a tubular straight-up-and-down shape, which involved minimizing the bust and hips.",1
"For men, corsets are more customarily used to slim the figure.",1
"An ""overbust corset"" encloses the torso, extending from just under the arms toward the hips.",1
"An ""underbust corset"" begins just under the breasts and extends down toward the hips.",1
"A ""longline corset"" – either overbust or underbust – extends past the iliac crest, or the hip bone.",1
"A longline corset is ideal for those who want increased stability, have longer torsos, or want to smooth out their hips.",1
"A ""standard"" length corset will stop short of the iliac crest and is ideal for those who want increased flexibility or have a shorter torso.",1
"Some corsets, in very rare instances, reach the knees.",1
"A shorter kind of corset that covers the waist area, is called a waist cincher.",1
"A corset may also include garters to hold up stockings; alternatively, a separate garter belt may be worn.",1
"Traditionally, a corset supports the visible dress and spreads the pressure from large dresses, such as the crinoline and bustle.",1
"At times, a corset cover is used to protect outer clothes from the corset and to smooth the lines of the corset.",1
The original corset cover was worn under the corset to provide a layer between it and the body.,1
"Corsets were not worn next to the skin, possibly due to difficulties with laundering these items during the 19th century, as they had steel boning and metal eyelets that would rust.",1
"The corset cover was generally in the form of a light chemise, made from cotton lawn or silk.",1
Modern corset wearers may wear corset liners for many of the same reasons.,1
Those who lace their corsets tightly use the liners to prevent burn on their skin from the laces.,1
"A specially designed corset, in which the breasts and vulva are exposed, can be worn during vanilla sex or BDSM activities.",1
"Corsets are held together by lacing, usually at the back.",1
"In the Victorian heyday of corsets, a well-to-do woman's corset laces would be tightened by her maid, and a gentleman's by his valet.",1
"However, Victorian corsets also had a buttoned or hooked front opening called a busk.",1
"If the corset was worn loosely, it was possible to leave the lacing as adjusted and take the corset on and off using the front opening.",1
"(If the corset is worn snugly, this method will damage the busk if the lacing is not significantly loosened beforehand).",1
The type of corset and bodice lacing became a refined mark of class; women who could not afford servants often wore front-laced bodices.,1
"Corsets were and are still usually designed for support, with freedom of body movement an important consideration in their design.",1
"Corsets were originally quilted waistcoats, which French women wore as an alternative to stiff corsets.",1
Corsets began to be made with some padding and more boning.,1
Corsets were one of the first mass-produced garments for women.,1
Corsets began to be more heavily boned in the 1840s.,1
The corsets of the 1850s–1860s were shorter than the corsets of the 19th century through 1840s.,1
"Whereas for many corseting was accepted as necessary for beauty, health, and an upright military-style posture, dress reformists viewed tightlacing as vain and, especially at the height of the era of Victorian morality, a sign of moral indecency.",1
This corset was straight in front with a pronounced curve at the back that forced the upper body forward and the derrière out.,1
"This style of corset was originally conceived as a health corset, which was a type of corset that was made of wool and reinforced with cording and promoted the healthy benefits of wearing wool next to skin.",1
However the S-Curve corset became the framework for many ornate fashions from the late 1890s and 1900s.,1
The corset reached its longest length in the early 20th century.,1
"At first, the longline corset reached from the bust down to the upper thigh.",1
"The corset fell from fashion in the 1920s in Europe and North America, replaced by girdles and elastic brassieres, but survived as an article of costume.",1
"In this case, the corset is underwear rather than outerwear.",1
Skilled corset makers are available to make reproductions of historic corset shapes or to design new styles.,1
"These included corsets, which were among items the protestors called ""instruments of female torture"" and accouterments of what they perceived to be enforced femininity.",1
"Since the late 1980s, the corset has experienced periodic revivals, all which have usually originated in haute couture and have occasionally trickled through to mainstream fashion.",1
These revivals focus on the corset as an item of outerwear rather than underwear.,1
; the costumes featured many corsets as characteristic of the era.,1
"It is like an ordinary corset, but it is long enough to cover the legs, partially or totally.",1
A person wearing a corset dress can have great difficulty in walking up and down the stairs and may be unable to sit down if the boning is too stiff.,1
Other types of corset dresses are created for unique high fashion looks by a few modern corset makers.,1
This type of corset and its purpose of improving posture does not have long term results.,1
"Like the neck corset, a collar serves some of the same purposes.",1
Neck corsets and collars have become a fashion statement instead of assets to improve posture.,1
"A dressmaker is a person who makes custom clothing for women, such as dresses, blouses, and evening gowns.",1
A dressmaker is also called a mantua-maker or a modiste.,1
Dressmaker in this sense is contrasted to tailored and has fallen out of use since the rise of casual wear in the mid-twentieth century.,1
"A custom dressmaker specializes in women's custom apparel, including day dresses, careerwear, suits, evening or bridal wear, sportswear, or lingerie.",1
Embroidery is the craft of decorating fabric or other materials using a needle to apply thread or yarn.,1

"In modern days, embroidery is usually seen on caps, hats, coats, blankets, dress shirts, denim, dresses, stockings, and golf shirts.",1
Embroidery is available with a wide variety of thread or yarn color.,1
The art of embroidery has been found worldwide and several early examples have been found.,1
"Embroidery was a skill marking a girl's path into womanhood as well as conveying rank and social standing.Conversely, embroidery is also a folk art, using materials that were accessible to nonprofessionals.",1
"Because embroidery was a sign of high social status in Muslim societies, it became widely popular.",1
"Embroidery cottage industries, some employing over 800 people, grew to supply these items.In the 16th century, in the reign of the Mughal Emperor Akbar, his chronicler Abu al-Fazl ibn Mubarak wrote in the famous Ain-i-Akbari:
""His majesty pays much attention to various stuffs; hence Irani, Ottoman, and Mongolian articles of wear are in much abundance especially textiles embroidered in the patterns of Nakshi, Saadi, Chikhan, Ari, Zardozi, Wastli, Gota and Kohra.",1
"The first embroidery machine was the hand embroidery machine, invented in France in 1832 by Josué Heilmann.",1
Counted-thread embroidery patterns are created by making stitches over a predetermined number of threads in the foundation fabric.,1
"Counted-thread embroidery is more easily worked on an even-weave foundation fabric such as embroidery canvas, aida cloth, or specially woven cotton and linen fabrics.",1
Embroidery can also be classified by the similarity of appearance.,1
Hardanger embroidery is a counted embroidery and the designs are often geometric.,1
"Today, embroidery thread is manufactured in cotton, rayon, and novelty yarns as well as in traditional wool, linen, and silk.",1
"Ribbon embroidery uses narrow ribbon in silk or silk/organza blend ribbon, most commonly to create floral motifs.Surface embroidery techniques such as chain stitch and couching or laid-work are the most economical of expensive yarns; couching is generally used for goldwork.",1
"In machine embroidery, different types of ""fills"" add texture and design to the finished work.",1
"Machine embroidery is used to add logos and monograms to business shirts or jackets, gifts, and team apparel as well as to decorate household linens, draperies, and decorator fabrics that mimic the elaborate hand embroidery of the past.",1
"Machine embroidery is most typically done with rayon thread, although polyester thread can also be used.",1
Users can use the embroidery software to digitize the digital embroidery designs.,1
"Contemporary embroidery artists believe hand embroidery has grown in popularity as a result of an increasing need for relaxation and digitally disconnecting practises.Modern hand embroidery, as opposed to cross-stitching, is characterised by a more ""liberal"" approach.",1

"Makers of knitted gloves, which did not retain perfume and had less social cachet, were organised in a separate guild, of bonnetiers who might knit silk as well as wool.",1
Knitted gloves were a refined handiwork that required five years of apprenticeship; defective work was subject to confiscation and burning.,1
"In the 17th century, gloves made of soft chicken skin became fashionable.",1
"The craze for gloves called ""limericks"" took hold.",1
"Gloves were found on the hands of King John when his tomb was opened in 1797 and on those of King Edward I when his tomb was opened in 1774.Pontifical gloves are liturgical ornaments used primarily by the pope, the cardinals, and bishops.",1
"The liturgical use of gloves has not been traced beyond the beginning of the 10th century, and their introduction may have been due to a simple desire to keep the hands clean for the holy mysteries, but others suggest that they were adopted as part of the increasing pomp with which the Carolingian bishops were surrounding themselves.",1

"A blind stitch in sewing is a method of joining two pieces of fabric so that the stitch thread is invisible, or nearly invisible.",1
"Blind stitching hides stitching under folded edges; therefore, this type of stitch can be used to create a blind hem or to join two folded edges together.Blind hem stitches are completely hidden on the front of the garment and almost completely hidden on the inside of the garment.",1
"Blind stitching is useful when joining two folded edges together, as the thread is only visible when the folded material is pulled away.",1
"""Blind stitch"" can also refer to a stitch that does not go all the way through the material, and can be used in stitching waterproof seams in neoprene and kamiks.",1
"Buttonhole stitch and the related blanket stitch are hand-sewing stitches used in tailoring, embroidery, and needle lace-making.Buttonhole stitches catch a loop of the thread on the surface of the fabric and needle is returned to the back of the fabric at a right angle to the original start of the thread.",1

Chain stitch is a sewing and embroidery technique in which a series of looped stitches form a chain-like pattern.,1
Chain stitch is an ancient craft – examples of surviving Chinese chain stitch embroidery worked in silk thread have been dated to the Warring States period.,1
Handmade chain stitch embroidery does not require that the needle pass through more than one layer of fabric.,1
"Because chain stitches can form flowing, curved lines, they are used in many surface embroidery styles that mimic ""drawing"" in thread.Chain stitches are also used in making tambour lace, needlelace, macramé and crochet.",1
Chain stitch embroidery has also been found dating to the Warring States period.,1
Chain stitch designs spread to Iran through the Silk Road.,1
The Double chain stitch uses two threads.,1
"Cross-stitch is a form of sewing and a popular form of counted-thread embroidery in which X-shaped stitches in a tiled, raster-like pattern are used to form a picture.",1
This form of cross-stitch is also called counted cross-stitch in order to distinguish it from other forms of cross-stitch.,1
Sometimes cross-stitch is done on designs printed on the fabric; the stitcher simply stitches over the printed pattern.,1
Cross-stitch is often executed on easily countable fabric called aida cloth whose weave creates a plainly visible grid of squares with holes for the needle at each corner.,1
"Fabrics used in cross-stitch include linen, aida, and mixed-content fabrics called 'evenweave' such as jobelan.",1
"All cross-stitch fabrics are technically ""evenweave"" as the term refers to the fact that the fabric is woven to make sure that there are the same number of threads per inch in both the warp and the weft (i.e.",1
Counted cross-stitch projects are worked from a gridded pattern called a chart and can be used on any count fabric; the count of the fabric and the number of threads per stitch determine the size of the finished stitching.,1
"Traditionally, cross-stitch was used to embellish items like household linens, tablecloths, dishcloths, and doilies.",1
"Although there are many cross-stitchers who still employ it in this fashion, it is now increasingly popular to work the pattern on pieces of fabric and hang them on the wall for decoration.",1
"Cross-stitch is also often used to make greeting cards, pillowtops, or as inserts for box tops, coasters and trivets.",1
"Besides designs created expressly for cross-stitch, there are software programs that convert a photograph or a fine art image into a chart suitable for stitching.",1
Hand-dyed cross-stitch floss is created just as the name implies—it is dyed by hand.,1
Cross-stitch is widely used in traditional Palestinian dressmaking.,1
Cross-stitch is often used together with other stitches.,1
A cross-stitch can come in a variety of prostational forms.,1
"The best known are Italian cross-stitch, Celtic Cross Stitch, Irish Cross Stitch, long-armed cross-stitch, Ukrainian cross-stitch and Montenegrin stitch.",1
"Italian cross-stitch and Montenegrin stitch are reversible, meaning the work looks the same on both sides.",1
"The double cross-stitch, also known as a Leviathan stitch or Smyrna cross-stitch, combines a cross-stitch with an upright cross-stitch.",1
"Cross-stitch is often combined with other popular forms of embroidery, such as Hardanger embroidery or blackwork embroidery.",1
"Cross-stitch may also be combined with other work, such as canvaswork or drawn thread work.",1
Other crafters have taken to cross-stitching on all manner of gridded objects as well including old kitchen strainers or chain-link fences.,1
Some cross-stitchers have commented on the way that the practice of embroidery makes them feel connected to the women who practised  it before them.,1
Embroidery stitches are also called stitches for short.,1
Embroidery stitches are the smallest units in embroidery.,1
Each embroidery stitch has a special name to help identify it.,1
Hemstitch or hem-stitch is a decorative drawn thread work or openwork hand-sewing technique for embellishing the hem of clothing or household linens.,1
"Unlike an ordinary hem, hemstitching can employ embroidery thread in a contrasting color so as to be noticeable.",1
"In hemstitching, one or more threads are drawn out of the fabric parallel and next to the turned hem, and stitches bundle the remaining threads in a variety of decorative patterns while securing the hem in place.",1
"There are also hemstitcher attachments for home sewing machines, and simple decorative stitches can be used over drawn threads to suggest hand-hemstitching.",1
A lockstitch is the most common mechanical stitch made by a sewing machine.,1
"Lockstitch is named because the two threads, upper and lower, ""lock"" together in the hole in the fabric which they pass through.",1
"Ideally, the lockstitch is formed in the centre of the thickness of the material — that is, ideally the upper thread entwines the lower thread in the middle of the material.",1
Most lockstitch machines made after the 1960s are capable of doing this; older machines achieve the same stitch with a specialist presser foot which moves the fabric beneath the stationary needle.,1
"Industrial lockstitch machines with two needles, each forming an independent lockstitch with their own bobbin, are also very common.",1
There are different types of lockstitch industrial machines.,1
Most industrial lockstitch machines sew only a straight line of stitches.,1
"An overlock is a kind of stitch that sews over the edge of one or two pieces of cloth for edging, hemming, or seaming.",1
"Usually an overlock sewing machine will cut the edges of the cloth as they are fed through, though some are made without cutters.",1
An overlock sewing machine differs from a lockstitch sewing machine in that it uses loopers fed by multiple thread cones rather than a bobbin.,1
"Overlock sewing machines usually run at high speeds, from 1000 to over 9000 rpm, and most are used in industry for edging, hemming and seaming a variety of fabrics and products.",1
"Overlock stitches are extremely versatile, as they can be used for decoration, reinforcement, or construction.",1
"Overlocking is also referred to as ""overedging"", ""merrowing"", or ""serging"".",1
"Though ""serging” technically refers to overlocking with cutters, in practice the four terms are used interchangeably.",1
"Consequently, many overlock machine companies established themselves in the Northeastern United States.",1
"Industrial overlock machines are generally made in 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 thread formations.",1
This completes the overlock stitch formation and begins the stitch cycle all over again.,1
Pad stitches are a type of running stitch made by placing small stitches perpendicular to the line of stitching.,1
Pad stitches secure two or more layers of fabric together and give the layers more firmness; smaller and denser stitches create more firmness.,1
"Tailors pad stitch a jacket's lapel and undercollar to give them additional firmness, and maintain their curvature.",1
"For example, pad stitches in a suit's lapel run parallel to the lapel's roll line; pad stitches in the under collar of a tailored jacket run parallel to the collar's back edge.",1
"A pick stitch in sewing is a simple running stitch that catches only a few threads of the fabric, showing very little of the thread on the right side of the garment.",1
"A pick stitch can be made from either the inside of the garment or the outside, depending upon how much thread is meant to show on the outside of the garment.",1
"A pick stitch is commonly used for making hems, although it is also used with contrasting thread to create a decorative finish on some garments.",1
"A pick stitch along the outside of a lapel is a hallmark of a ""high-end, hand-made"" men's suit or blazer.",1
A finely made pick stitch is difficult to accomplish but can be achieved with practice.,1
Rantering is a type of stitching made to conceal a seam line that runs across the grain of the joined pieces of fabric.,1
Rantering stitches take hold of the nap of the fabric and pull it closed over the seam.,1
A rantering stitch would also be used in the process of mending a garment to conceal seam lines produced in that process.,1
"The running stitch or straight stitch is the basic stitch in hand-sewing and embroidery, on which all other forms of sewing are based.",1
A running stitch runs through the fabric.,1
Running stitches are most often not visible as they are used to close seams.,1
Loosely spaced rows of short running stitches are used to support padded satin stitch.,1
"Running stitches are a component of many traditional embroidery styles, including kantha of India and Bangladesh, and Japanese sashiko quilting and other embroidery styles such as pattern darning and redwork.",1
"Holbein or double-running stitches have a second row of running stitches worked in a reverse direction in between the stitches of the first pass, to make a solid line of stitching.",1
Sashiko is a form of decorative reinforcement stitching from Japan that started out of practical need during the Edo era.,1
"By the Meiji era sashiko had been established enough that it had evolved into winter work in northern farming communities, when it was too cold to work outside.Mostly geometric patterns are used to make this work.",1
"Common motifs used in sashiko are waves, mountains, bamboo, bishamon, key fret, double cypress fence, arrow feathers, seven treasures, pampas grass, overlapping diamonds, linked diamonds, lightning, linked hexagons and persimmon flower.",1
The embroidery uses special sashiko thread and needle.,1
"Modern day sashiko stitching is not restricted to the traditional indigo coloured fabric but uses a variety of colour combinations, and it is considered a beautiful surface embellishment for fabrics.",1
"Many sashiko patterns were derived from Chinese designs, but just as many were developed by the Japanese embroiderers.",1
"Topstitching is a sewing technique where the line of stitching is designed to be seen from the outside of the garment, either decorative or functional.",1
"Topstitching is used most often on garment edges such as necklines and hems, where it helps facings to stay in place and gives a crisp edge.",1
"Decorative topstitching is designed to show, and may be done in a fancy thread or with a special type of stitch.",1
"Otherwise, topstitching is generally done using a straight stitch with a thread that matches the fashion fabric.",1
A zigzag stitch is variant geometry of the lockstitch.,1
"When creating a zigzag stitch, the side to side motion of the sewing machine's needle is controlled by a cam.",1
"The neckline is the top edge of a garment that surrounds the neck, especially from the front view.",1
"Neckline also refers to the overall line between all the layers of clothing and the neck and shoulders of a person, ignoring the unseen undergarments.For each garment worn above the waist, the neckline is primarily a style line and may be a boundary for further shaping of the upper edge of a garment with, for example, a collar, cowl, darts, or pleats.",1
"A variation is the portrait neckline.off-the-shoulder (one edge, nearly linear.",1
"Also known as Carmen neckline)these are similar to boat necklines but are significantly lower, below the shoulders and collar bone.",1
"These necklines accentuate the shoulders and neck of the wearer.one-shoulder necklinethese are asymmetrical linear necklines that cut across the torso diagonally, usually from one shoulder to under the other arm.halter necklinethese feature a V-neck or scoop front neckline with straps which wrap around and connect at the nape of the neck.sweetheart necklinethese have a curved bottom edge that is concave down and usually doubly scalloped to resemble the top half of a heart.",1
"Sweetheart necklines accentuate the bosom.keyhole necklinethese are similar to halter necklines, but the converging diagonal lines meet in front of the neck, forming a ""keyhole"".",1
"These necklines are seen infrequently.illusion necklinea compromise between a low and a high neckline, it combines a low neckline with semi-transparent fabric along the top part, thus creating a second, higher neckline.",1
This neckline is often seen on traditional white wedding dresses.,1
"The neckline can be a sharp edge of fabric or a more gentle cowl, and can also be accentuated by pattern(s) in the fabric itself.",1
"Felled seam, or flat-fell seam, is a seam made by placing one edge inside a folded edge of fabric, then stitching the fold down.",1
"A flat felled seam can be used on various fabrics not just denim, they can even be used on fabrics such as voile which is a flimsy fabric.",1
Seam allowance is the area between the fabric edge and the stitching line on two pieces of material being sewn together.,1
Seam allowances can range from 1⁄4 inch wide to as much as several inches.,1
"A style line is a seam in a garment made primarily for the purpose of its visual effect, rather than for the purpose of shaping of structuring the garment.",1
"Bias tape or bias binding is a narrow strip of fabric, cut on the bias.",1
"Bias tape is used in making piping, binding seams, finishing raw edges, etc.",1

"Single-fold bias tape is bias tape with each raw edge folded in toward the center, wrong sides together, and pressed.",1
"Double-fold bias tape is single-fold bias tape which has been folded in half and pressed, with the single folds to the inside.",1
"A collar stay, collar stick, collar tab, collar stiffener, or collar stiff is a shirt accessory consisting of a smooth strip of rigid material, rounded at one end and pointed at the other, inserted into specially made pockets on the underside of a shirt collar to stabilize the collar's points.",1
"Some metallic collar stays are sold with a magnet, which is used to hold the stiffened collar in place against the shirt.",1
"A different type of collar stay discreetly adds a button hook on one end, to help fasten tiny buttons on dress shirts; e.g.",1
"Adhesive collar stays can be stuck to the underside of a collar to either add stiffness or attach the collar points to the shirt.Collar stays are removed from shirts before dry cleaning or pressing, as the cleaning process can damage both the shirt and the stays; they are replaced prior to wearing.",1
"Galloon is a decorative woven trim sometimes in the form of a braid and commonly made of metallic gold or silver thread, lace, or embroidery.",1

"Grommets are generally flared or collared on each side to keep them in place, and are often made of metal, plastic, or rubber.",1
"A small grommet may also be called an eyelet, used for example on shoes, tarps and sails for lacing purposes.Grommets in electrical applications are referred to as ""insulating bushings"".",1
"There are also dedicated grommet presses with punch and anvil, as shown in the picture, ranging from inexpensive to better-quality tools, which are somewhat faster to use.",1
"The grommet prevents the cord from tearing through the hole, thereby providing structural integrity.",1
"Small grommets are also called eyelets, especially when used in clothing or crafting.",1
"Tight fitting rubber grommets can also prevent the entry of dirt, air, water, etc.",1
"Molded and continuous strip grommets, also known as edge grommets, are manufactured in a wide variety of sizes and lengths expressly for this purpose; they are usually a single piece which can be inserted by hand.",1
"Sleeved grommets have a flexible extension, usually tapered or moulded to flex increasingly towards the free end in order to reduce fracturing of electrical insulation.",1
Grommets are used in a similar way to acoustically isolate electronic circuit components that are susceptible to microphonism caused by mechanical vibration or jarring.,1

"Type IB “buckle-loops” were even more similar to Type IA buckles, only difference being that instead of dolphin-heads, they were adorned with horse-heads.",1
"There were also Type II buckles used by Romans, but all types of Roman buckles could have served purposes for simple clothing as well, and predominantly, as a military purpose.Aside from the practical use found in Roman buckles, Scythian and Sarmatian buckles incorporated animal motifs that were characteristic to their respective decorative arts.",1
"The oldest Roman buckles are of a simple ""D""-shaped frame, in which the prong or tongue extends from one side to the other.",1
"In the 14th century, buckles with a double-loop or ""8""-shaped frame emerged.",1
The prongs of these buckles attach to the center post.,1
"The appearance of multi-part buckles with chapes and removable pins, which were commonly found on shoes, occurred in the 17th century.",1
"Buckle frames come in various shapes, sizes, and decorations.",1
"This made buckles easily removable and interchangeable, leading to a significant advantage since buckles were expensive.",1
"Buckles fitted with ""T""-, anchor-, or spade-shaped chapes avoided this problem but needed a slotted end in the belt to accommodate them.The belt buckle chapes are frequently made in a form of a plate, thus the name buckle plate.",1
"In the 18th century, brass buckles incorporated iron bars, chapes, and prongs due to the parts being made by different manufactures.",1
Silver was also used in buckle manufacturing for its malleability and for being strong and durable with an attractive shine.,1
One method of creating glass buckles was gluing individual discs of glass to the metal frame.,1
The male buckle member consists of a center rod and two spring prongs equally spaced from the center rod.,1
The female buckle member has a front open side and two side holes which hold and secure the two spring arms of the male buckle member.,1
"This sort of buckle may be found connecting many strapped items such as pet harnesses, safety harnesses, personal flotation jackets, fanny packs and other bags, belts, gun slings, and boots.",1
"Buttonholes are reinforced holes in fabric that buttons pass through, allowing one piece of fabric to be secured to another.",1
The raw edges of a buttonhole are usually finished with stitching.,1
"Buttonholes can also refer to flowers worn in the lapel buttonhole of a coat or jacket, which are referred to simply as ""buttonholes"" or boutonnières.",1
"The buttonhole construction sometimes includes a technique called stranding where a flat piece of gimp cord or thread is incorporated into the edges to act as a reinforcement.A Milanese buttonhole: after the hole for the button is cut, a length of silk thread called a gimp is laid around the edges.",1
A glossier buttonhole thread is then wrapped around the gimp and sewn through the cloth surrounding the buttonhole.,1
"A machine-made buttonhole is usually sewn with two parallel rows of machine sewing in a narrow zig-zag stitch, with the ends finished in a bar tack created using a broader zig-zag stitch.",1
One of the first automatic buttonhole machines was invented by Henry Alonzo House in 1862.,1
A bound buttonhole is one which has its raw edges encased by pieces of fabric or trim instead of stitches.,1
"A keyhole buttonhole is a special case of a thread-finished buttonhole that has a round hole at the end of the buttonhole slit, reinforced with a fan-shaped array of stitches.",1
Keyhole buttonholes are most often found on tailored coats and jackets.,1
This buttonhole is normally machine-made due to the difficulty of achieving it by hand working.,1
A hook-and-eye closure is a very simple and secure method of fastening garments together.,1
"Hook-and-loop fasteners, hook-and-pile fasteners or touch fasteners consist of two components: typically, two lineal fabric strips which are attached to the opposing surfaces to be fastened.",1
"By the mid-1960s hook-and-loop fasteners were used in the futuristic creations of fashion designers such as Pierre Cardin, André Courrèges and Paco Rabanne.Later improvements included strengthening the filament by adding polyester.In 1978 de Mestral's patent expired, prompting a flood of low-cost imitations from Taiwan, China and South Korea onto the market.",1
"A snap fastener is a pair of interlocking discs, made out of a metal or plastic, commonly used in place of traditional buttons to fasten clothing and for similar purposes.",1
"Snap fasteners are a noted detail in American Western wear and are also often chosen for children's clothing, as they are relatively easy for children to use compared with traditional buttons.",1
The Prym company has produced snap fasteners since 1903.,1
"A zipper, zip, fly, dingy, or zip fastener, formerly known as a clasp locker, is a commonly used device for binding the edges of an opening of fabric or other flexible material, such as on a garment or a bag.",1
"Zippers come in all different sizes, shapes, and colors.",1
"The word zipper is onomatopoetic, because it was named for the sound the device makes when used, a high-pitched zip.",1
Some jackets have double-separating zippers with two sliders on the tape.,1
"Zippers may:

increase or decrease the size of an opening to allow or restrict the passage of objects, as in the fly of trousers or in a pocket;
join or separate two ends or sides of a single garment, as in the front of a jacket, or on the front, back or side of a dress or skirt to facilitate dressing;
attach or detach a separable part of the garment to or from another, as in the conversion between trousers and shorts or the connection or disconnection of a hood and a coat;
attach or detach a small pouch or bag to or from a larger one.",1
"A zipper costs relatively little, but if it fails, the garment may be unusable until the zipper is repaired or replaced—which can be quite difficult and expensive.",1
Problems often lie with the zipper slider; when it becomes worn it does not properly align and join the alternating teeth.,1
"With separating zippers, the insertion pin may tear loose from the tape; the tape may even disintegrate from use.",1
"If a zipper fails, it can either jam (i.e.",1
"The popular North American term zipper,, came from the B. F. Goodrich Company in 1923.",1
"Zippers began being used for clothing in 1925 by Schott Bros. on leather jackets.In the 1930s, a sales campaign began for children's clothing featuring zippers.",1
The campaign praised zippers for promoting self-reliance in young children by making it possible for them to dress in self-help clothing.,1
"The zipper beat the button in 1937 in the ""Battle of the Fly"", after French fashion designers raved over zippers in men's trousers.",1
"Esquire declared the zipper the ""Newest Tailoring Idea for Men"" and among the zippered fly's many virtues was that it would exclude ""The Possibility of Unintentional and Embarrassing Disarray.",1
"Today the zipper is by far the most widespread fastener, and is used on clothing, luggage, leather goods, and various other objects.",1
Coil zippers are made of polyester coil and are thus also termed polyester zippers.,1
"Invisible zippers have the teeth hidden behind a tape, so that the zipper is invisible.",1
This kind of a zipper is common in skirts and dresses.,1
Invisible zippers are usually coil zippers.,1
"A regular invisible zipper uses a lighter lace-like fabric on the zipper tape, instead of the common heavier woven fabric on other zippers.",1
Reverse coil zippers are a variation of the coil zipper.,1
"In a reverse coil zipper, the coil is on the reverse side of the zipper and the slider works on the flat side of the zipper.",1
"Unlike an invisible zipper where the coil is also on the back, the reverse coil shows stitching on the front side and the slider accommodates a variety of pulls.",1
Water resistant zippers are generally configured as reverse coil so that the pvc coating can cover the stitching.,1
"Metal zippers  are the classic zipper type, found mostly in jeans and pencil cases today.",1
"Metal zippers are made in brass, aluminum and nickel, according to the metal used for teeth making.",1
All these zippers are basically made from flat wire.,1
"A special type of metal zipper is made from pre-formed wire, usually brass but sometimes other metals too.",1
"This type of pre-formed metal zippers is mainly used in high grade jeans-wear, work-wear, etc., where high strength is required and zippers need to withstand tough washing.",1
"Plastic-molded zippers  are identical to metallic zippers, except that the teeth are plastic instead of metal.",1
Metal zippers can be painted to match the surrounding fabric; plastic zippers can be made in any color of plastic.,1
"Plastic zippers mostly use polyacetal resin, though other thermoplastic polymers are used as well, such as polyethylene.",1
"Open-ended zippers  use a box and pin mechanism to lock the two sides of the zipper into place, often in jackets.",1
Open-ended zippers can be of any of the above described types.,1
"Two way open-ended zippers  Instead of having an insertion pin and pin box at the bottom, a two way open-ended zipper has a puller on each end of the zipper tape.",1
Two way closed-ended zippers  are closed at both ends; they are often used in luggage and can have either one or two pullers on the zipper.,1
Magnetic zippers  allow for one-handed closure and are used in sportswear.,1
"When the zipper is closed, the two facing sides of the plastic sheeting are squeezed tightly against one another both above and below the zipper teeth, forming a double seal.This double-mated surface is good at retaining both vacuum and pressure, but the fit must be very tight, to press the surfaces together firmly.",1
"Consequently, these zippers are typically very stiff when zipped shut and have minimal flex or stretch.",1
"These zippers are very common where airtight or watertight seals are needed, such as on scuba diving dry suits, ocean survival suits, and hazmat suits.",1
"A less common water-resistant zipper is similar in construction to a standard toothed zipper, but includes a molded plastic ridge seal similar to the mating surfaces on a ziploc bag.",1
"Such a zipper is easier to open and close than a clipped version, and the slider has a gap above the zipper teeth for separating the ridge seal.",1
Ridge-sealed zippers are sometimes used on lower-cost surface dry suits.,1
"The handle of the fly zipper is folded flat against the teeth when it is not in use, and the handle is held down by both slider hinge tension and the fabric flap over the fly.",1
"To move the zipper, the handle is pulled outward against spring tension, lifting the pins out from between the teeth as the slider moves.",1
"The zipper is analogous in function to a drawstring, but different in mechanism.",1
"The zipper works by an elastic, that is, reversible, deformation of the ""locking members"".",1
The zipper teeth are shaped and sized so that the forces which act on the zipper when the garment it is sewn on is worn cannot unlock the teeth.,1
"The zipper is analogous in mechanism to a bobby pin, where the person's hand slides hair into and out of the pin's ""contractible jaw"".",1
Most often the zipper fails to close due to a worn or bent slider not being able to apply the necessary force to the sides of the teeth to cause them to interlock.,1
"A selvage or selvedge is a ""self-finished"" edge of fabric, keeping it from unraveling and fraying.",1
"In woven fabric, selvages are the edges that run parallel to the warp, and are created by the weft thread looping back at the end of each row.",1
"In knitted fabrics, selvages are the unfinished yet structurally sound edges that were neither cast on nor bound off.",1
"Historically, the term selvage applied only to loom woven fabric, though now can be applied to flat-knitted fabric.",1
"The terms selvage and selvedge are a corruption of ""self-edge"", and have been in use since the 16th century.",1
Selvages form the extreme lateral edges of the fabric and are formed during the weaving process.,1
"Most selvages are narrow, but some may be as wide as .75 inches.",1
"Descriptions woven into the selvage using special jacquards, colored or fancy threads may be incorporated for identification purposes.",1
For many end-uses the selvage is discarded.,1
Selvages are 'finished' and will not fray because the weft threads double back on themselves and are looped under and over the warp.,1
Also in industry sometimes the selvage is made thicker with a binding thread.,1
"Selvages of fabrics formed on weaving machines with shuttles, such as hand looms, are formed by the weft turning at the end of each pick or every second pick.",1
"To prevent fraying, various selvage motions are used to bind the warp into the body of the cloth.",1
Selvages are created to protect the fabric during weaving and subsequent processing (i.e.,1
"A plain weave selvage is the other option, where the last few threads on either side are woven in plain weave.",1
"In industry the selvage may be thicker than the rest of the fabric, and is where the main weft threads are reinforced with a tight weft back binding to prevent fraying.",1
"Selvages on machine-woven fabric often have little holes along their length, through the thick part, and can also have some fringe.",1
The type or motion of selvage depends on the weaving technique or loom used.,1
"The selvage is then created by a heat cutter which trims the thread at both ends close to the edge of the cloth, and then it is beaten into place.",1
Thus it creates a firm selvage with the same thickness as the rest of the cloth.,1
Thicker selvages are also more difficult to sew through.,1
"Using the selvage eliminates unnecessary work, thus the garment article can be made faster, the finished garment is less bulky and can be stitched entirely by machine.",1
Selvages in knitting can either bear a special pattern worked into the first and last stitches or simply be the edge of the fabric.,1
"The two most common selvage stitches are the chain-edge selvage and the slipped-garter edge, both of which produce a nice edge.",1
"The chain-edge selvage is made by alternating rows of slipping the first stitch knitwise and knitting the last stitch, with rows of slipping the first stitch purlwise and purling the last stitch.",1
"Other selvages include a garter stitch border one stitch wide, or a combination of the above techniques.Knitting selvages makes the fabric easier to sew together than it would be otherwise.",1
A textile is a flexible material consisting of a network of natural or artificial fibers.,1
"Textiles are formed by weaving, knitting, crocheting, knotting , tatting, felting, or braiding.",1
"A textile is any material made of interlacing fibres, including carpeting and geotextiles.",1
The production of textiles is a craft whose speed and scale of production has been altered almost beyond recognition by industrialization and the introduction of modern manufacturing techniques.,1
"Textiles are used in many traditional crafts such as sewing, quilting  and embroidery.",1
"Textiles for industrial purposes, and chosen for characteristics other than their appearance, are commonly referred to as technical textiles.",1
"Technical textiles include textile structures for automotive applications, medical textiles (e.g.",1
"implants), geotextiles, agrotextiles, protective clothing (e.g.",1
"Textiles are made in various strengths and degrees of durability, from the finest microfibre made of strands thinner than one denier to the sturdiest canvas.",1
"Textile manufacturing terminology has a wealth of descriptive terms, from light gauze-like gossamer to heavy grosgrain cloth and beyond.",1
"Other animal textiles which are made from hair or fur are alpaca wool, vicuña wool, llama wool, and camel hair, generally used in the production of coats, jackets, ponchos, blankets, and other warm coverings.",1
Silk is an animal textile made from the fibres of the cocoon of the Chinese silkworm which is spun into a smooth fabric prized for its softness.,1
Nonwoven textiles are manufactured by the bonding of fibres to make fabric.,1
"Coloured designs in textiles can be created by weaving together fibres of different colours, adding coloured stitches to finished fabric, creating patterns by resist dyeing methods, tying off areas of cloth and dyeing the rest, or drawing wax designs on cloth and dyeing in between them, or using various printing processes on finished fabric.",1
"Textiles are also sometimes bleached, making the textile pale or white.",1
Textiles are sometimes finished by chemical processes to change their characteristics.,1

"Yarn is a long continuous length of interlocked fibres, suitable for use in the production of textiles, sewing, crocheting, knitting, weaving, embroidery, or ropemaking.",1
Thread is a type of yarn intended for sewing by hand or machine.,1
Embroidery threads are yarns specifically designed for needlework.,1
Many types of yarn are made differently though.,1
"More rarely, yarn may be spun from camel, yak, possum, musk ox, vicuña, cat, dog, wolf, rabbit, or bison hair, and even chinchilla as well as turkey or ostrich feathers.",1
"T-shirt yarn is a yarn made directly from t-shirts, and the fiber composition is determined by the material the t-shirt is made from.",1
"Some types of protein yarns may feel irritating to some people, causing sensations of contact dermatitis, hives, wheezing reactions.",1
Cotton and viscose yarns burn as a wick.,1
Synthetic yarns generally tend to melt though some synthetics are inherently flame-retardant.,1
Both synthetic and natural yarns can pill.,1
"Single ply yarns or using fibers like merino wool are known to pill more due to the fact that in the former, the single ply is not tight enough to securely retain all the fibers under abrasion, and the merino wool's short staple length allows the ends of the fibers to pop out of the twist more easily.",1
"Yarns combining synthetic and natural fibers inherit the properties of each parent, according to the proportional composition.",1
"Twisting fibres into yarn in the process called spinning can be dated back to the Upper Paleolithic, and yarn spinning was one of the very first processes to be industrialized.",1
"Spun yarns may contain a single type of fibre, or be a blend of various types.",1
"Yarn is selected for different textiles based on the characteristics of the yarn fibres, such as warmth, light weight, durability, or softness.",1
"Yarn is composed of twisted strands of fiber, which are known as plies when grouped together.",1
These strands of yarn are twisted together in the opposite direction to make a thicker yarn.,1
"For a single ply yarn, the direction of the final twist is the same as its original twist.",1
"The twist direction of yarn can affect the final properties of the fabric, and combined use of the two twist directions can nullify skewing in knitted fabric.The mechanical integrity of yarn is derived from frictional contacts between its composing fibers.",1
"Texturized yarns are made by a process of air texturizing filament yarns, which combines multiple filament yarns into a yarn with some of the characteristics of spun yarns.",1
Slub Effect  means a yarn with thick and thin sections alternating regularly or irregularly.,1
"Most yarns have a single uniform hue, but there is also a wide selection of variegated yarns:

Heathered or tweed: yarn with flecks of different coloured fibre
Ombre: variegated yarn with light and dark shades of a single hue
Multicolored: variegated yarn with two or more distinct hues
Self-striping: yarn dyed with lengths of colour that will automatically create stripes in a knitted or crocheted object
Marled: yarn made from strands of different-coloured yarn twisted together, sometimes in closely related hues

Yarn quantities for handcrafts are usually measured and sold by weight in ounces or grams.",1
"The actual length of the yarn contained in a ball or skein can vary due to the inherent heaviness of the fibre and the thickness of the strand; for instance, a 50 g skein of lace weight mohair may contain several hundred metres, while a 50 g skein of bulky wool may contain only 60 metres.",1
"The Craft Yarn Council of America is making an effort to promote a standardized industry system for measuring this, numbering the weights from 1 to 6.",1
"Another measurement of yarn weight, often used by weavers, is wraps per inch.",1
The yarn is wrapped snugly around a ruler and the number of wraps that fit in an inch are counted.,1
"Labels on yarn for handicrafts often include information on gauge, known in the UK as tension, which is a measurement of how many stitches and rows are produced per inch or per cm on a specified size of knitting needle or crochet hook.",1
These show how the yarn looks in different kinds of clothes when magnified.,1
"A bobbin is a spindle or cylinder, with or without flanges, on which wire, yarn, thread or film is wound.",1
"Bobbins are typically found in sewing machines, cameras, and within electronic equipment.",1
In non-electrical applications the bobbin is used for tidy storage without tangles.,1
"Tension of the bobbin thread is maintained with a bobbin case, a metal enclosure with a leaf spring which keeps the thread taut.",1
"Bobbins vary in shape and size, depending on the style of bobbin driver in the machine for which they are intended to be used.",1
"Long, narrow bobbins are used in early transverse shuttle and vibrating shuttle machines.",1
"These shorter, wider bobbins are familiar to modern sewers, as the rotary/shuttle hook remains in use on modern machines essentially unchanged.",1
"Both traditional and contemporary bobbins may be decorated with designs, inscriptions, or pewter or wire inlays.",1
"Often, bobbins are 'spangled' to provide additional weight to keep the thread in tension.",1
"Antique and unique bobbins, sometimes spangled, are highly sought-after by antiques collectors.",1
The bobbin may be made of thermoplastic or thermosetting materials.,1
A dress form is a three-dimensional model of the torso used for fitting clothing that is being designed or sewed.,1
Dress forms come in all sizes and shapes for almost every article of clothing that can be made.,1
"Dress forms in standard clothing sizes are used to make patterns, while adjustable dress forms allow garments to be tailored to fit a specific individual.",1
"Later on, dress forms were designed to look ‘more realistic’, a modification that gave them arms, legs, and sometimes heads.",1
When a dress form has a full body like this they are known as manikins or mannequins.,1
"The retail stores began shedding dress forms and getting mannequins in favor of showing off hats, leggings, and other wear that would be unseen on simply a torso.",1
"2D dress forms that appear on hangers, or 2D Mannequins, are used to show how clothes would fit on a human but due to their 2D nature they are not used to show how things would look on people.",1
"Dress forms now are discontinued in store display windows in favor to mannequins, though ‘2D Mannequins’ are often used.",1
"A needlecase or needle case is a small, often decorative, holder for sewing needles.",1
"Early needlecases were usually small tubular containers of bone, wood, or bronze with tight-fitting stoppers, often designed to hang from a belt.",1
Needlecases are sometimes called by the French name étui and are typically one of the tools attached to a chatelaine.,1
"Needlecases were a necessity for storing these fragile objects, and are found in cultures around the world.",1
Tubular bronze needlecases are common finds from Viking-age sites in Europe.,1
"Cane needlecases were found in a grave from Cerro Azul, Peru, dated to 1000–1470 AD.",1
"Bone, leather, and metal needlecases have been found from Medieval London, and bone or ivory needlecases were made by the Inuit people.",1
Bone and ivory needlecases and pin poppets were also popular in 18th century America.Elaborate needlework confections like the frog-shaped needlecase in the Los Angeles County Museum of Art appeared by the 16th century.,1
Heavily decorated silver and brass needlecases are typical of the Victorian period.,1
A needle threader is a device for helping to put thread through the eye of a needle.,1
"The typical needle threader of this type has the image of a woman, possibly Ariadne, in profile stamped into the plate handle.Another type of needle threader is mechanically operated.",1
A pattern notcher is a common tool used in patternmaking and sewing that creates a notch in a paper pattern.,1
"A pin is a device used for fastening objects or material together, and can have three sorts of body:  a shaft of a rigid inflexible material meant to be inserted in a slot, groove, or hole; a shaft connected to a head and ending in a sharp tip meant to pierce one or more pieces of soft materials like cloth or paper; a single strip of a rigid but flexible material (e.g.",1
"the bobby pin), or two strips of a rigid material bound together by a spring at one end so that, when the spring held open, one can insert some material between the prongs at the other end that, the spring allowed to close, then clamp the inserted material.",1
"According to their function, pins can be made of metals (e.g.",1
"Later, pins were also used to hold pages of books together by threading the needle through their top corner.Many later pins were made of brass, a relatively hard and ductile metal that became available during the Bronze Age.",1
"John Ireland Howe invented a pin-making machine in 1832, and an improved machine in 1841; his Howe Manufacturing Company of Derby, Connecticut, used three machines to produce 72,000 pins per day in 1839.",1
Walter Hunt invented the safety pin by forming an eight-inch brass pin into a bent pin with a spring and guard.,1
"These pins are also called ""map pins"" and are distinguished by having an easy to grip head.",1
See also drawing pin or thumb tack.,1
"A pincushion is a small, stuffed cushion, typically 3–5 cm across, which is used in sewing to store pins or needles with their heads protruding to take hold of them easily, collect them, and keep them organized.",1
Pincushions are typically filled tightly with stuffing to hold pins rigidly in place.,1
"Typically, the pincushion was filled with cotton, wool, horsehair, or sawdust, though some were filled with emery powder, an abrasive to clean and sharpen the pins..
During the 18th century, weighted pincushions became popular among seamstresses.",1
The pincushion half of the doll may be made of satin fabric and trimmings to resemble a skirt.,1
"The original popularity of the pincushion dolls continued into the early 20th century, and some styles reflect Art Deco or similar 20th-century styles.",1
"Pinking shears are scissors, the blades of which are sawtoothed instead of straight.",1
The pinking shears design was patented by Louise Austin in 1893.,1
"True dressmaker's pinking shears, however, should not be used for paper decoration because paper dulls the cutting edge.",1
A pair of scissors consists of a pair of metal blades pivoted so that the sharpened edges slide against each other when the handles opposite to the pivot are closed.,1
"Scissors are used for cutting various thin materials, such as paper, cardboard, metal foil, cloth, rope, and wire.",1
A large variety of scissors and shears all exist for specialized purposes.,1
"Using the incorrect type of scissors to cut hair will result in increased damage or split ends, or both, by breaking the hair.",1
Modern scissors are often designed ergonomically with composite thermoplastic and rubber handles which enable the user to exert either a power grip or a precision grip.,1
Spring scissors continued to be used in Europe until the 16th century.,1
"However, pivoted scissors of bronze or iron, in which the blades were pivoted at a point between the tips and the handles, the direct ancestor of modern scissors, were invented by the Romans around 100 AD.",1
"The company is still manufacturing scissors today, and is the oldest company in the West to do so.",1
"Pivoted scissors were not manufactured in large numbers until 1761, when Robert Hinchliffe of Sheffield produced the first pair of modern-day scissors made of hardened and polished cast steel.",1
"In lower-quality scissors, the cutting edges are not particularly sharp; it is primarily the shearing action between the two blades that cuts the material.",1
"In high-quality scissors, the blades can be both extremely sharp, and tension sprung – to increase the cutting and shearing tension only at the exact point where the blades meet.",1
"Children's scissors are usually not particularly sharp, and the tips of the blades are often blunted or 'rounded' for safety.",1
"Mechanically, scissors are a first-class double-lever with the pivot acting as the fulcrum.",1
Scissors cut material by applying at the cutting location a local shear stress which exceeds the material's shear strength.,1
"Some scissors have an appendage, called a finger brace or finger tang, below the index finger hole for the middle finger to rest on to provide for better control and more power in precision cutting.",1
"Because scissors have overlapping blades, they are not symmetric.",1
"For right-handed scissors held in the right hand, the thumb blade is closer to the user's body, so that the natural tendency of the right hand is to force the cutting blades together.",1
"Conversely, if right-handed scissors are held in the left hand, the natural tendency of the left hand would be to force the cutting blades laterally apart.",1
"Furthermore, with right-handed scissors held by the right hand, the shearing edge is visible, but when they are used with the left hand, the cutting edge of the scissors is behind the top blade, and one cannot see what is being cut.",1
Some scissors are marketed as ambidextrous.,1
"However, most ""ambidextrous"" scissors are in fact still right-handed in that the upper blade is on the right, and hence is on the outside when held in the right hand.",1
True ambidextrous scissors are possible if the blades are double-edged and one handle is swung all the way around so that the back of the blades become the new cutting edges.,1
"For cases where scissors appear in or are represented by the final art product, see Commons:Category:Scissors in art.",1
Running with Scissors is a 2006 film based on the memoir of the same title.,1
"One of the three shapes, 'scissors', is made by extending the index and middle fingers to mimic the shape of most scissors.",1

"Asia
In Pakistan, some believe that scissors should never be idly opened and closed without purpose; this is believed to cause bad luck.",1
Sometimes the scissors were kept open to make the shape of a cross for extra protection.,1
"A seam ripper is a small sewing tool used for cutting and removing stitches.The most common form consists of a handle, shaft and head.",1
"A sewing gauge is a ruler, typically 6 inches long, used for measuring short spaces.",1
"A sewing needle, used for hand-sewing, is a long slender tool with a pointed tip at one end and a hole at the other.",1

"A stitching awl is a tool with which holes can be punctured in a variety of materials, or existing holes can be enlarged.",1
Stitching awls are frequently used by shoe repairers and other leatherworkers.,1
A tape measure or measuring tape is a flexible ruler used to measure size or distance.,1
Spring return pocket tape measures will generally fit in a pocket.,1
Pocket tape measures have a tape 1 to 15 feet in length and 1⁄4 to 3⁄4 inch across.,1
A second tape measure design is what is called the long tape.,1
"These are cased tape measures with tapes of 25, 50, 75, 100, 200, 300, and even 500 feet in length, designed for engineers and builders.",1
Tape measures are often designed for specific uses or trades.,1
Tape measures that were intended for use in tailoring or dressmaking were made from flexible cloth or plastic.,1
These types of tape measures were mainly used for the measuring of the subject’s waist line.,1
This type of tape measure will have a floating tang or hook on the end to aid measuring.,1
A tape measure of 25 or even 100 feet can wind into a relatively small container.,1
The self-marking tape measure allows the user an accurate one hand measure.,1
Tape measures often have black and red measurements on a yellow background as this is the optimal color combination for readability.,1
The use of millimeter only tape measures for housing construction is a part of the US metric building code.,1
The dual scale tape measure is in both US Customary Inches and Centimeters.,1
"Like the American tape measures described above, they also have markings every 16 in and 19.2 in.",1
A thimble is a small hard pitted cup worn for protection on the finger that pushes the needle in sewing.,1
"Usually, thimbles with a closed top are used by dressmakers but special thimbles with an opening at the end are used by tailors as this allows them to manipulate the cloth more easily.",1
Finger guards differ from tailors' thimbles in that they often have a top but are open on one side.,1
Medieval thimbles were either cast brass or made from hammered sheet.,1
"Early centers of thimble production were those places known for brass-working, starting with Nuremberg in the 15th century, and moving to Holland by the 17th.",1
"Early thimbles were sometimes made from whale bone, horn, or ivory.",1
"Rarer works from thimble makers utilized diamonds, sapphires, or rubies.",1
Advanced thimblemakers enhanced thimbles with semi-precious stones to adorn the apex or along the outer rim.,1

"Clement Greenberg's 1960 article ""Modernist Painting"" defines modern art as ""the use of characteristic methods of a discipline to criticize the discipline itself"".",1
"After Greenberg, several important art theorists emerged, such as Michael Fried, T. J. Clark, Rosalind Krauss, Linda Nochlin and Griselda Pollock among others.",1
"Artists of the 1980s, 1990s, and 2000s expanded this technique of self-criticism beyond high art to all cultural image-making, including fashion images, comics, billboards and pornography.Duchamp once proposed that art is any activity of any kind-everything.",1

"""Anti-art is a label for art that intentionally challenges the established parameters and values of art; it is term associated with Dadaism and attributed to Marcel Duchamp just before World War I, when he was making art from found objects.",1
"Anti-art is a feature of work by Situationist International, the lo-fi Mail art movement, and the Young British Artists, though it is a form still rejected by the Stuckists, who describe themselves as anti-anti-art.Architecture is often included as one of the visual arts; however, like the decorative arts, or advertising, it involves the creation of objects where the practical considerations of use are essential in a way that they usually are not in a painting, for example.",1
"However, ""good"" art is not always or even regularly aesthetically appealing to a majority of viewers.",1
"In other words, an artist's prime motivation need not be the pursuit of the aesthetic.",1
"Also, art often depicts terrible images made for social, moral, or thought-provoking reasons.",1
Art is often intended to appeal to and connect with human emotion.,1

Biomedical engineering has the highest percentage of female engineers compared to other common engineering professions.,1
"In general, a chemical engineer is one who applies and uses principles of chemical engineering in any of its various practical applications; these often include 1) design, manufacture, and operation of plants and machinery in industrial chemical and related processes; 2) development of new or adapted substances for products ranging from foods and beverages to cosmetics to cleaners to pharmaceutical ingredients, among many other products; and 3) development of new technologies such as fuel cells, hydrogen power and nanotechnology, as well as working in fields wholly or partially derived from chemical engineering such as materials science, polymer engineering, and biomedical engineering.",1
"The modern discipline of chemical engineering, however, encompasses much more than just process engineering.",1
"Chemical engineers are now engaged in the development and production of a diverse range of products, as well as in commodity and specialty chemicals.",1

"Electrical engineering is now divided into a wide range of fields, including computer engineering, power engineering, telecommunications, radio-frequency engineering, signal processing, instrumentation, and electronics.",1
Electrical engineering became a profession in the later 19th century.,1
"The first electrical engineering degree program in the United States was started at Massachusetts Institute of Technology in the physics department under Professor Charles Cross,  though it was Cornell University to produce the world's first electrical engineering graduates in 1885.",1
The first course in electrical engineering was taught in 1883 in Cornell's Sibley College of Mechanical Engineering and Mechanic Arts.,1
During these decades use of electrical engineering increased dramatically.,1
Many disciplines of electrical engineering use tests specific to their discipline.,1

Instrumentation and Measurement in Electrical Engineering.,1
"An engineering technician is primarily trained in the skills and techniques related to a specific branch of engineering, with a practical understanding of the relevant engineering concepts.",1
"Engineering technicians often assist engineers and technologists in projects relating to research and development, or focus on post-development activities like implementation or operation.",1
An engineering technician is between a skilled craft worker and a technologist.,1

"These specialization are: methods engineering technicians, materials handling technicians, plant layout technicians, work measurement and time study technicians, production control technicians, inventory control technicians, quality control technicians, cost control technicians, and budget technicians.",1
"Subjects that industrial engineering technicians must be fluent in are science, computer applications, mathematics, English, technologies education, and drafting and Mechanical systems drawings.",1
An engineering technologist is a professional trained in certain aspects of development and implementation of a respective area of technology.,1
"Engineering technologists often assist engineers but after years of experience, they can also become engineers.",1
"Like engineers, areas where engineering technologists can work include product design, fabrication and testing.",1
"Also as with engineers, engineering technologists sometimes rise to senior management positions in industry or become entrepreneurs.",1
Engineering technologists are more likely than engineers to focus on implementation or operation of a technology but this is not a strict rule as they often do design original concepts.,1
"In general, the work of engineering technologists focuses more often on practical application of engineered products and processes for a range of purposes, whereas the work of engineers emphasizes application of math and science for design/development purposes.",1
"In general, an engineering technologist receives a broad range of applied science and applied mathematics training, as well as the fundamentals of engineering in the student's area of focus.",1
An engineering technologist is also expected to have had some coursework in ethics.,1
The Engineering Technologist Mobility Forum is an international forum held by signatories of the Sydney Accord to explore mutual recognition for experienced engineering technologists and to remove artificial barriers to the free movement and practice of engineering technologists amongst their countries.,1
A certified engineering technologist is usually required to apprentice for a term before being able to apply for certification through a local governing body.,1
"In that time, the engineering technologist must have completed tasks which directly apply to his or her area of study.",1
"In the United States, engineering technologist certification requires a bachelor's degree in an engineering technology program accredited by the ETAC/ABET.",1
Engineering technologist registration in the United States is conducted by many independent societies and organizations.,1
"UK engineering technologists have always been designated as ""engineers"".",1
"The modern term for an engineering technologist is ""incorporated engineer"", although since 2000 the normal route to achieving IEng is with a bachelors or honors degree in engineering.",1
"To be eligible for the engineering technologist examination, candidates must fulfill the following requirements: completion of one of the school systems, an apprenticeship of at least two years duration, one year of completed professional work experience and attendance of a taught program with a course load of 2400–3000 hours, usually completed within two years in full-time or 3.5 – 4 years part-time at vocational colleges.As of January 2012, the state-certified engineer/engineering technologist was allocated to level 6 of the European Qualifications Framework, equivalent to undergraduate degrees.",1
"Furthermore, the engineering technologist constitutes an advanced entry qualification for German universities and in principal permits entry into any undergraduate academic degree program.",1
"The engineering technologist/state-certified engineer should not be confused with academically qualified engineers, which previously graduated from universities as Diplom-Ingenieur and following the Bologna process with BEng + MEng degrees.",1
Petrochemicals are the chemical products obtained from petroleum by refining.,1
The two most common petrochemical classes are olefins and aromatics.,1
"The largest petrochemical industries are located in the USA and Western Europe; however, major growth in new production capacity is in the Middle East and Asia.",1
There is substantial inter-regional petrochemical trade.,1
"Primary petrochemicals are divided into three groups depending on their chemical structure:

Olefins includes Ethene, Propene, Butenes and butadiene.",1
"Like commodity chemicals, petrochemicals are made on a very large scale.",1
Petrochemical manufacturing units differ from commodity chemical plants in that they often produce a number of related products.,1

Not all of the petrochemical or commodity chemical materials produced by the chemical industry are made in one single location but groups of related materials are often made in adjacent manufacturing plants to induce industrial symbiosis as well as material and utility efficiency and other economies of scale.,1
"The large scale petrochemical manufacturing locations have clusters of manufacturing units that share utilities and large scale infrastructure such as power stations, storage tanks, port facilities, road and rail terminals.",1
"Mechanical engineering is an engineering discipline that combines engineering physics and mathematics principles with materials science to design, analyze, manufacture, and maintain mechanical systems.",1
"The mechanical engineering field requires an understanding of core areas including mechanics, dynamics, thermodynamics, materials science, structural analysis, and electricity.",1

"In addition to the core mechanical engineering curriculum, many mechanical engineering programs offer more specialized programs and classes, such as control systems, robotics, transport and logistics, cryogenics, fuel technology, automotive engineering, biomechanics, vibration, optics and others, if a separate department does not exist for these subjects.Most mechanical engineering programs also require varying amounts of research or community projects to gain practical problem-solving experience.",1
"As mechanical engineering begins to merge with other disciplines, as seen in mechatronics, multidisciplinary design optimization is being used with other CAE programs to automate and improve the iterative design process.",1
"Composite material research within mechanical engineering typically focuses on designing stronger or more rigid materials while attempting to reduce weight, susceptibility to corrosion, and other undesirable factors.",1
"Areas of current mechanical engineering research in nanotechnology include nanofilters, nanofilms, and nanostructures, among others.",1
A computational scientist is a person skilled in scientific computing.,1

Practical mathematics has been a human activity from as far back as written records exist.,1
"Mathematics developed at a relatively slow pace until the Renaissance, when mathematical innovations interacting with new scientific discoveries led to a rapid increase in the rate of mathematical discovery that has continued to the present day.Mathematics is essential in many fields, including natural science, engineering, medicine, finance, and the social sciences.",1
"Applied mathematics has led to entirely new mathematical disciplines, such as statistics and game theory.",1
"Mathematicians engage in pure mathematics without having any application in mind, but practical applications for what began as pure mathematics are often discovered later.",1
"Evidence for more complex mathematics does not appear until around 3000 BC, when the Babylonians and Egyptians began using arithmetic, algebra and geometry for taxation and other financial calculations, for building and construction, and for astronomy.",1
It is in Babylonian mathematics that elementary arithmetic first appear in the archaeological record.,1
"Other notable achievements of Greek mathematics are conic sections, trigonometry, and the beginnings of algebra.",1

"Experimental mathematics continues to grow in importance within mathematics, and computation and simulation are playing an increasing role in both the sciences and mathematics.",1
"But often mathematics inspired by one area proves useful in many areas, and joins the general stock of mathematical concepts.",1
"However pure mathematics topics often turn out to have applications, e.g.",1
"Several areas of applied mathematics have merged with related traditions outside of mathematics and become disciplines in their own right, including statistics, operations research, and computer science.",1
The popularity of recreational mathematics is another sign of the pleasure many find in solving mathematical questions.,1
"Before that, mathematics was written out in words, limiting mathematical discovery.",1
"Modern notation makes mathematics much easier for the professional, but beginners often find it daunting.",1
"Nonetheless mathematics is often imagined to be nothing but set theory in some axiomatization, in the sense that every mathematical statement or proof could be cast into formulas within set theory.",1
Discrete mathematics conventionally groups together the fields of mathematics which study mathematical structures that are fundamentally discrete rather than continuous.,1
Mathematics then studies properties of those sets that can be expressed in terms of that structure; for instance number theory studies properties of the set of integers that can be expressed in terms of arithmetic operations.,1
Trigonometry is the branch of mathematics that deals with relationships between the sides and the angles of triangles and with the trigonometric functions.,1
"Thus, ""applied mathematics"" is a mathematical science with specialized knowledge.",1
"The term applied mathematics also describes the professional specialty in which mathematicians work on practical problems; as a profession focused on practical problems, applied mathematics focuses on the ""formulation, study, and use of mathematical models"" in science, engineering, and other areas of mathematical practice.",1
"Thus, the activity of applied mathematics is vitally connected with research in pure mathematics.",1
Other areas of computational mathematics include computer algebra and symbolic computation.,1
"The Wolf Prize in Mathematics, instituted in 1978, recognizes lifetime achievement, and another major international award, the Abel Prize, was instituted in 2003.",1
"A number is a mathematical object used to count, measure, and label.",1
"For being manipulated, individual numbers need to be represented by symbols, called numerals; for example, ""5"" is a numeral that represents the number five.",1
"As only a small number of symbols can be memorized, basic numerals are commonly organized in a numeral system, which is an organized way to represent any number.",1
"In mathematics, the notion of number has been extended over the centuries to include 0, negative numbers, rational numbers such as 1/2 and −2/3, real numbers such as √2 and π, and complex numbers, which extend the real numbers with a square root of −1.",1
"Calculations with numbers are done with arithmetical operations, the most familiar being addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and exponentiation.",1
"Besides their practical uses, numbers have cultural significance throughout the world.",1
"Today, number systems are considered important special examples of much more general categories such as rings and fields, and the application of the term ""number"" is a matter of convention, without fundamental significance.",1
"He treated 0 as a number and discussed operations involving it, including division.",1
"During the 600s, negative numbers were in use in India to represent debts.",1
The first use of negative numbers in a European work was by Nicolas Chuquet during the 15th century.,1
"The system of hyperreal numbers represents a rigorous method of treating the ideas about infinite and infinitesimal numbers that had been used casually by mathematicians, scientists, and engineers ever since the invention of infinitesimal calculus by Newton and Leibniz.",1
"(See imaginary number for a discussion of the ""reality"" of complex numbers.)",1
The existence of complex numbers was not completely accepted until Caspar Wessel described the geometrical interpretation in 1799.,1
"Gauss studied complex numbers of the form a + bi, where a and b are integral, or rational.",1
"Other such classes of complex numbers derive from the roots of unity xk − 1 = 0 for higher values of k. This generalization is largely due to Ernst Kummer, who also invented ideal numbers, which were expressed as geometrical entities by Felix Klein in 1893.",1
The prime number theorem was finally proved by Jacques Hadamard and Charles de la Vallée-Poussin in 1896.,1
"The major categories of numbers are as follows:
There is generally no problem in identifying each number system with a proper subset of the next one, because each of these number systems is canonically isomorphic to a proper subset of the next one.",1
"Traditionally, the sequence of natural numbers started with 1",1
"For instance, the number 3 can be represented as the class of all sets that have exactly three elements.",1
"Alternatively, in Peano Arithmetic, the number 3 is represented as sss0, where s is the ""successor"" function.",1
Negative numbers are usually written with a negative sign.,1
"When the set of negative numbers is combined with the set of natural numbers, the result is defined as the set of integers, Z also written 
  
    
      
        
          Z
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \mathbb {Z} }
  .",1
The set of all rational numbers includes the integers since every integer can be written as a fraction with denominator 1.,1
"The symbol for the rational numbers is Q, also written 
  
    
      
        
          Q
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \mathbb {Q} }
  .",1
They include all the measuring numbers.,1
Every real number corresponds to a point on the number line.,1
"The treatment of negative real numbers is according to the general rules of arithmetic and their denotation is simply prefixing the corresponding positive numeral by a minus sign, e.g.",1
"Most real numbers can only be approximated by decimal numerals, in which a decimal point is placed to the right of the digit with place value 1.",1
"A real number can be expressed by a finite number of decimal digits only if it is rational and its fractional part has a denominator whose prime factors are 2 or 5 or both, because these are the prime factors of 10, the base of the decimal system.",1
Representing other real numbers as decimals would require an infinite sequence of digits to the right of the decimal point.,1
A real number that is not rational is called irrational.,1
"A famous irrational real number is the number π, the ratio of the circumference of any circle to its diameter.",1
"Another well-known number, proven to be an irrational real number, is

  
    
      
        
          
            2

    {\displaystyle {\sqrt {2}}=1.41421356237\dots ,}
  the square root of 2, that is, the unique positive real number whose square is 2.",1
Both these numbers have been approximated to trillions of digits.,1
"Any rounded or truncated number is necessarily a rational number, of which there are only countably many.",1
"A given real number has only the following decimal representations: an approximation to some finite number of decimal places, an approximation in which a pattern is established that continues for an unlimited number of decimal places or an exact value with only finitely many decimal places.",1
Thus the exact real number 3.74 can also be written 3.7399999999... and 3.74000000000....,1
The real numbers also have an important but highly technical property called the least upper bound property.,1
"The real numbers are not, however, an algebraically closed field, because they do not include a solution to the algebraic equation 
  
    
      
        
          x
          
            2

        =
        0
      
    
    {\displaystyle x^{2}+1=0}
  .",1
This set of numbers arose historically from trying to find closed formulas for the roots of cubic and quadratic polynomials.,1
"The complex numbers consist of all numbers of the form

  
    
      
        
        a
        +
        b
        i
      
    
    {\displaystyle \,a+bi}
  where a and b are real numbers.",1
"Because of this, complex numbers correspond to points on the complex plane, a vector space of two real dimensions.",1
Thus the real numbers are a subset of the complex numbers.,1
"The symbol for the complex numbers is C or 
  
    
      
        
          C

"Like the reals, the complex numbers form a field, which is complete, but unlike the real numbers, it is not ordered.",1
"In technical terms, the complex numbers lack a total order that is compatible with field operations.",1
"Any odd number n may be constructed by the formula n = 2k + 1, for a suitable integer k. Starting with k = 0, the first non-negative odd numbers are {1, 3, 5, 7, ...}.",1
Any even number m has the form m = 2k where k is again an integer.,1
"Similarly, the first non-negative even numbers are {0, 2, 4, 6, ...}.",1
"The first few prime numbers are 2, 3, 5, 7, and 11.",1
Real numbers that are not rational numbers are called irrational numbers.,1
Complex numbers which are not algebraic are called transcendental numbers.,1
The algebraic numbers that are solutions of a monic polynomial equation with integer coefficients are called algebraic integers.,1
"The computable numbers are stable for all usual arithmetic operations, including the computation of the roots of a polynomial, and thus form a real closed field that contains the real algebraic numbers.",1
The computable numbers may be viewed as the real numbers that may be exactly represented in a computer: a computable number is exactly represented by its first digits and a program for computing further digits.,1
"However, the computable numbers are rarely used in practice.",1
The set of computable numbers has the same cardinality as the natural numbers.,1
"Therefore, almost all real numbers are non-computable.",1
"The number system that results depends on what base is used for the digits: any base is possible, but a prime number base provides the best mathematical properties.",1
"The set of the p-adic numbers contains the rational numbers, but is not contained in the complex numbers.",1
The p-adic numbers play an important role in this analogy.,1
They are sometimes called hypercomplex numbers.,1
"(2001) [1994], ""Number"",  in Hazewinkel, Michiel (ed.",1
"Data are characteristics or information, usually numerical, that are collected through observation.",1
"In a more technical sense, data is a set of values of qualitative or quantitative variables about one or more persons or objects, while a datum is a single value of a single variable.Although the terms ""data"" and ""information"" are often used interchangeably, these terms have distinct meanings.",1
"In some popular publications, data is sometimes said to be transformed into information when it is viewed in context or in post-analysis.",1
"Data is employed in scientific research, businesses management, finance, governance, and in virtually every other form of human organizational activity.",1
"Data is measured, collected and reported, and analyzed, whereupon it can be visualized using graphs, images or other analysis tools.",1
Data as a general concept refers to the fact that some existing information or knowledge is represented or coded in some form suitable for better usage or processing.,1
"Raw data is a collection of numbers or characters before it has been ""cleaned"" and corrected by researchers.",1
Raw data needs to be corrected to remove outliers or obvious instrument or data entry errors.,1
"Data processing commonly occurs by stages, and the ""processed data"" from one stage may be considered the ""raw data"" of the next stage.",1
"Field data is raw data that is collected in an uncontrolled ""in situ"" environment.",1
Experimental data is data that is generated within the context of a scientific investigation by observation and recording.,1
Data has been described as the new oil of the digital economy.,1
"The word ""data"" was first used to mean ""transmissible and storable computer information"" in 1946.",1
"The expression ""data processing"" was first used in 1954.The Latin word data is the plural of datum, ""(thing) given,"" neuter past participle of dare ""to give"".",1
"Data may be used as a plural noun in this sense, with some writers—usually scientific writers—in the 20th century using datum in the singular and data for plural.",1
"However, in everyday language, ""data"" is most commonly used in the singular, as a mass noun.",1
"According to a common view, data is collected and analyzed; data only becomes information suitable for making decisions once it has been analyzed in some fashion.",1
This data may be included in a book along with other data on Mount Everest to describe the mountain in a manner useful for those who wish to make a decision about the best method to climb it.,1
"Data is often assumed to be the least abstract concept, information the next least, and knowledge the most abstract.",1
"In this view, data becomes information by interpretation; e.g., the height of Mount Everest is generally considered ""data"", a book on Mount Everest geological characteristics may be considered ""information"", and a climber's guidebook containing practical information on the best way to reach Mount Everest's peak may be considered ""knowledge"".",1
These patterns in data are seen as information which can be used to enhance knowledge.,1
Marks are no longer considered data once the link between the mark and observation is broken.Mechanical computing devices are classified according to the means by which they represent data.,1
Some special forms of data are distinguished.,1
"The prototypical example of metadata is the library catalog, which is a description of the contents of books.",1

"Quantity is a property that can exist as a multitude or magnitude, which illustrate discontinuity and continuity.",1
"Quantity is among the basic classes of things along with quality, substance, change, and relation.",1
Aristotle regarded quantity as a fundamental ontological and scientific category.,1
"In Aristotle's ontology, quantity or quantum was classified into two different types, which he characterized as follows:

'Quantum' means that which is divisible into two or more constituent parts, of which each is by nature a 'one' and a 'this'.",1
The mathematical usage of a quantity can then be varied and so is situationally dependent.,1
Quantity was considered to be divided into the discrete and the continuous.,1
"The magnitude of an intensive quantity does not depend on the size, or extent, of the object or system of which the quantity is a property, whereas magnitudes of an extensive quantity are additive for parts of an entity or subsystems.",1
"The quantity is expressed by identifiers, definite and indefinite, and quantifiers, definite and indefinite, as well as by three types of nouns: 1. count unit nouns or countables; 2. mass nouns, uncountables, referring to the indefinite, unidentified amounts; 3. nouns of multitude.",1
"A structure is an arrangement and organization of interrelated elements in a material object or system, or the object or system so organized.",1

"Types of structure include a hierarchy, a network featuring many-to-many links, or a lattice featuring connections between components that are neighbors in space.",1
"Built structures are broadly divided by their varying design approaches and standards, into categories including building structures, architectural structures, civil engineering structures and mechanical structures.",1
"The majority of everyday load-bearing structures are section-active structures like frames, which are primarily composed of one-dimensional structures.",1
"Other types are Vector-active structures such as trusses, surface-active structures such as shells and folded plates, form-active structures such as cable or membrane structures, and hybrid structures.Load-bearing biological structures such as bones, teeth, shells, and tendons derive their strength from a multilevel hierarchy of structures employing biominerals and proteins, at the bottom of which are collagen fibrils.",1

Protein structure has a four-level hierarchy.,1
The primary structure is the sequence of amino acids that make it up.,1
The secondary structure consists of repeated patterns determined by hydrogen bonding.,1

Structures are applicable to people in how a society is as a system organized by a characteristic pattern of relationships.,1
Sociologists have studied the changing structure of these groups.,1
Structure and agency are two confronted theories about human behaviour.,1
"Structure here refers to factors such as social class, religion, gender, ethnicity, customs, etc.",1
"Data structures are built out of two basic types: An array has an index that can be used for immediate access to any data item, but depending on the programming language used, its size must be specified when it is initialized.",1

"In Isaac Newton's view, space was absolute—in the sense that it existed permanently and independently of whether there was any matter in the space.",1
Newton's theories about space and time helped him explain the movement of objects.,1
"While his theory of space is considered the most influential in Physics, it emerged from his predecessors' ideas about the same.As one of the pioneers of modern science, Galileo revised the established Aristotelian and Ptolemaic ideas about a geocentric cosmos.",1
"Cartesian space was Euclidean in structure—infinite, uniform and flat.",1
"For Leibniz, then, space was an idealised abstraction from the relations between individual entities or their possible locations and therefore could not be continuous but must be discrete.",1
Space could be thought of in a similar way to the relations between family members.,1
Leibniz argued that space could not exist independently of objects in the world because that implies a difference between two universes exactly alike except for the location of the material world in each universe.,1
Newton took space to be more than relations between material objects and based his position on observation and experimentation.,1
"According to Kant, knowledge about space is synthetic, in that statements about space are not simply true by virtue of the meaning of the words in the statement.",1
"For example, vector spaces such as function spaces may have infinite numbers of independent dimensions and a notion of distance very different from Euclidean space, and topological spaces replace the concept of distance with a more abstract idea of nearness.",1
"Today, our three-dimensional space is viewed as embedded in a four-dimensional spacetime, called Minkowski space.",1
The idea behind space-time is that time is hyperbolic-orthogonal to each of the three spatial dimensions.,1
"In addition, time and space dimensions should not be viewed as exactly equivalent in Minkowski space-time.",1
One can freely move in space but not in time.,1
"Thus, time and space coordinates are treated differently both in special relativity and in general relativity.",1

Ownership of space is not restricted to land.,1
Ownership of airspace and of waters is decided internationally.,1
"Public space is a term used to define areas of land as collectively owned by the community, and managed in their name by delegated bodies; such spaces are open to all, while private property is the land culturally owned by an individual or company, for their own use and pleasure.",1

"Calculus, originally called infinitesimal calculus or ""the calculus of infinitesimals"", is the mathematical study of continuous change, in the same way that geometry is the study of shape and algebra is the study of generalizations of arithmetic operations.",1
"Today, calculus has widespread uses in science, engineering, and economics.In mathematics education, calculus denotes courses of elementary mathematical analysis, which are mainly  devoted to the study of functions and limits.",1
"The word calculus is a  Latin word, meaning originally ""small pebble"".",1
The formal study of calculus brought together Cavalieri's infinitesimals with the calculus of finite differences developed in Europe at around the same time.,1
"He used the methods of calculus to solve the problem of planetary motion, the shape of the surface of a rotating fluid, the oblateness of the earth, the motion of a weight sliding on a cycloid, and many other problems discussed in his Principia Mathematica.",1
"Newton called his calculus ""the science of fluxions"".",1
"In early calculus the use of infinitesimal quantities was thought unrigorous, and was fiercely criticized by a number of authors, most notably Michel Rolle and Bishop Berkeley.",1
The reach of calculus has also been greatly extended.,1
The development of calculus was built on earlier concepts of instantaneous motion and area underneath curves.,1

Science is a systematic enterprise that builds and organizes knowledge in the form of testable explanations and predictions about the universe.The earliest roots of science can be traced to Ancient Egypt and Mesopotamia in around 3500 to 3000 BCE.,1
"""Modern science is typically divided into three major branches that consist of the natural sciences, which study nature in the broadest sense; the social sciences, which study individuals and societies; and the formal sciences, which study abstract concepts.",1
"Modern science is distinct in its approach and successful in its results, so it now defines what science is in the strictest sense of the term.",1
"Science in its original sense was a word for a type of knowledge, rather than a specialized word for the pursuit of such knowledge.",1
"However, the general fields of science and much of the general knowledge from the ancient world remained preserved through the works of the early Latin encyclopedists like Isidore of Seville.",1
"This new science began to see itself as describing ""laws of nature"".",1
Bacon also argued that science should aim for the first time at practical inventions for the improvement of all human life.,1
"Both natural and social sciences are empirical sciences as their knowledge is based on empirical observations and is capable of being tested for its validity by other researchers working under the same conditions.There are also closely related disciplines that use science, such as engineering and medicine, which are sometimes described as applied sciences.",1
"Physical science is subdivided into branches, including physics, chemistry, astronomy and earth science.",1
Modern natural science is the successor to the natural philosophy that began in Ancient Greece.,1
"Systematic data collection, including discovery science, succeeded natural history, which emerged in the 16th century by describing and classifying plants, animals, minerals, and so on.",1
"The formal sciences share similarities with the other two branches by relying on objective, careful, and systematic study of an area of knowledge.",1
"The formal sciences are therefore a priori disciplines and because of this, there is disagreement on whether they actually constitute a science.",1
"Nevertheless, the formal sciences play an important role in the empirical sciences.",1

Methodological naturalism maintains that proper science requires strict adherence to empirical study and independent verification as a process for properly developing and evaluating explanations for observable phenomena.,1
The philosopher of science Karl Popper sharply distinguished truth from certainty.,1
Knowledge in science is gained by a gradual synthesis of information from different experiments by various researchers across different branches of science; it is more like a climb than a leap.,1
"He held that the successful sciences trust not to any single chain of inference but to the cable of multiple and various arguments intimately connected.Stanovich also asserts that science avoids searching for a ""magic bullet""; it avoids the single-cause fallacy.",1
"Science has become so pervasive in modern societies that it is generally considered necessary to communicate the achievements, news, and ambitions of scientists to a wider populace.",1

"Women faced considerable discrimination in science, much as they did in other areas of male-dominated societies, such as frequently being passed over for job opportunities and denied credit for their work.",1
"The achievements of women in science have been attributed to their defiance of their traditional role as laborers within the domestic sphere.In the late 20th century, active recruitment of women and elimination of institutional discrimination on the basis of sex greatly increased the number of women scientists, but large gender disparities remain in some fields; in the early 21st century over half of new biologists were female, while 80% of PhDs in physics are given to men.",1
Scholars in the sociology of science argue that learned societies are of key importance and their formation assists in the emergence and development of new disciplines or professions.,1
"The professionalization of science, begun in the 19th century, was partly enabled by the creation of distinguished academy of sciences in a number of countries such as the Italian Accademia dei Lincei in 1603, the British Royal Society in 1660, the French Académie des Sciences in 1666, the American National Academy of Sciences in 1863, the German Kaiser Wilhelm Institute in 1911, and the Chinese Academy of Sciences in 1928. International scientific organizations, such as the International Council for Science, have since been formed to promote cooperation between the scientific communities of different nations.",1
Science policy also refers to the act of applying scientific knowledge and consensus to the development of public policies.,1
Science policy thus deals with the entire domain of issues that involve the natural sciences.,1

A diplomatic mission or foreign mission is a group of people from one state or an organization present in another state to represent the sending state/organization officially in the receiving state.,1
"In practice, the phrase diplomatic mission usually denotes the resident mission, namely the embassy, which is the main office of a country's diplomatic representatives to another country; this is usually, but not necessarily, in the receiving state's capital city.",1
"As well as being a diplomatic mission to the country in which it is situated, it may also be a non-resident permanent mission to one or more other countries.",1

"A consulate is a diplomatic mission that is similar to a consulate general, but may not provide a full range of services.",1
"The members of a diplomatic mission can reside within or outside the building that holds the mission's chancery, and their private residences enjoy the same rights as the premises of the mission as regards inviolability and protection.All missions to the United Nations are known simply as permanent missions, while EU member states' missions to the European Union are known as permanent representations, and the head of such a mission is typically both a permanent representative and an ambassador.",1
"Rather, the premises of diplomatic missions usually remain under the jurisdiction of the host state while being afforded special privileges by the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations.",1
"Diplomatic missions between members of the British Commonwealth of Nations are not called embassies, but high commissions, for Commonwealth nations share a special diplomatic relationship.",1
The rights and immunities of diplomatic missions are codified in the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations.,1
"They are nevertheless not diplomatic missions, their personnel are not diplomats and do not have diplomatic visas, although there may be legislation providing for personal immunities and tax privileges, as in the case of the Hong Kong offices in London and Toronto, for example.",1
"An embassy is a diplomatic mission generally located in the capital city of another country which offers a full range of services, including consular services.",1

"Where an embassy was headed by an ambassador, a legation was headed by a minister.",1
"The term embassy is commonly used also as a section of a building in which the work of the diplomatic mission is carried out, but, strictly speaking, it is the diplomatic delegation itself that is the embassy, while the office space and the diplomatic work done is called the chancery.",1
"Therefore, the embassy operates in the chancery.",1
"Once inside the embassy, diplomatic channels can be used to solve the issue and send the refugees to another country.",1
"Notable violations of embassy extraterritoriality include repeated invasions of the British Embassy, Beijing, the hostage crisis at the American embassy in Tehran, Iran, and the Japanese embassy hostage crisis at the ambassador's residence in Lima, Peru.",1

It is the remit of sociologists to study why these norms exist; how they change over time; and how they are enforced.,1
"As argued by notable environmental sociologist John Bellamy Foster, the predecessor to modern environmental sociology is Marx's analysis of the metabolic rift, which influenced contemporary thought on sustainability.",1
Today political sociologists are as likely to be concerned with how identities are formed that contribute to structural domination by one group over another; the politics of who knows how and with what authority; and questions of how power is contested in social interactions in such a way as to bring about widespread cultural and social change.,1

"Examples of trans female drag queens, sometimes called trans queens, include Monica Beverly Hillz and Peppermint.",1
"Cisgender female drag queens are sometimes called faux queens or bioqueens, though both terms are problematic: faux carries the connotation that the drag is fake, and the use of bioqueen exclusively for cisgender females is a misnomer since trans female queens also have female bodies.",1

"Nevertheless, all geisha, regardless of region or district, are trained in the traditional arts, making the distinction of prestige one of history and tradition.",1
"By watching other geisha, and with the assistance of the owner of the geisha house, apprentices also become skilled dealing with clients and in the complex traditions surrounding selecting and wearing kimono, a floor length silk robe embroidered with intricate designs which is held together by a sash at the waist which is called an obi.Traditionally the shikomi stage of training lasted for years, and some girls were bonded to geisha houses as children.",1

"Geisha engagements may include flirting with men and playful innuendos; however, clients know that nothing more can be expected.",1
"The practice continues today, though geisha do not take danna anywhere as commonly, and though intimacy in a danna partnership was in previous decades not seen as essential, in modern times it is valued to a much greater degree, due to the formal nature of the commitment and the awareness by both parties of how expensive it can be.",1
""".The English term ""geisha girl"" soon became a byword for any female Japanese sex worker, whether actually selling sex or not; the term was applied to bar hostesses and streetwalkers alike.",1

teleplays, songs, and essays as well as other reports and news articles that may be of interest to the public.",1
Writers' texts are published across a range of media.,1
"Skilled writers who are able to use language to express ideas well, often contribute significantly to the cultural content of a society.The term ""writer"" is also used elsewhere in the arts and music – such as songwriter or a screenwriter – but as a standalone ""writer"" normally refers to the creation of written language.",1

"Screenwriters may start their careers by writing the screenplay speculatively; that is, they write a script with no advance payment, solicitation or contract.",1
Self-employed writers who are paid by contract to write are known as freelancers and screenwriters often work under this type of arrangement.,1

Sometimes writers have had the bad fortune to lose their work and have had to start again.,1
"(In very earlier times, writers used vellum and clay which were more robust materials.)",1

I can not dance unless thou leadest.",1
"As has been shown above, dance has been represented through the ages as having emerged as a response to music yet, as Lincoln Kirstein implied, it is at least as likely that primitive music arose from dance.",1
"Shawn concurs, stating that dance ""was the first art of the human race, and the matrix out of which all other arts grew"" and that even the ""metre in our poetry today is a result of the accents necessitated by body movement, as the dancing and reciting were performed simultaneously"" – an assertion somewhat supported by the common use of the term ""foot"" to describe the fundamental rhythmic units of poetry.",1

"In the book Fans, Bloggers, and Gamers, Henry Jenkins stated that ""Bloggers take knowledge in their own hands, enabling successful navigation within and between these emerging knowledge cultures.",1
"Blogs are given rankings by Alexa Internet, and formerly by blog search engine Technorati based on the number of incoming links.",1

"In book publishing, a commissioning editor is essentially a buyer.",1
Some magazines also employ commissioning editors.,1
"In some companies commissioning editors are also responsible for overseeing the copy-editing, typesetting, proofreading, and design of books, although in other companies this responsibility is assumed by other staff e.g.",1
"Often commissioning editors are also responsible for managing books that have already been published, for example by ensuring that stock levels are adequate and advising on when a book needs to be reprinted.",1
Most commissioning editors work up to the post through experience in other roles e.g.,1
"Although copy editors are generally expected to make simple revisions to smooth awkward passages, they do not have a license to rewrite a text line by line, nor do they prepare material on an author's behalf.",1
"Furthermore, copy editors are expected to query structural and organizational problems, but they are not expected to fix these problems.",1
"An organization's highest-ranking copy editor, or the supervising editor of a group of copy editors, may be known as the copy chief, copy desk chief, or news editor.",1
"As the prefix sub suggests, copy editors typically have less authority than regular editors.In the context of the Internet, online copy refers to the textual content of web pages.",1
Therefore copy editors are encouraged to respect the author's preference if it is acceptable.,1
Copy editors can either fix the content by rewriting it or heavily editing it.,1
"However, the copy editor will often point out any difficult passages for the author to resolve on his or her own time.Although copy editors are not responsible for factual correctness of the document, they can provide comments for the author on any information that they know to be untrue, such as year discrepancies or misleading ideas.",1
Such fact-checking is acceptable for copy editors who know the document's subject matter.The copy editor must also point out any biased language without infringing on the author's meaning.,1
"To do this, the copy editor will permit intentional ""politically incorrect"" views and censor only marginalized, offensive, or exclusive language.",1
This is also why the copy editor should write legibly and neatly.,1
"Copy editors working hard-copy write their corrections in the text directly, leaving the margins for querying.",1
"Usually, the copy editor is asked to write in a bright color, so the author and other parties can easily recognize the editor's changes.",1
"In the past, copy editors were sometimes known humorously as ""rim rats"".",1
"Chief copy editors are still sometimes called ""the slot"".",1
"Many copy editors have a college degree, often in journalism, communications, or the language of the writing that they edit.",1
"The traditional copy editor was once defined as editing for grammar, spelling, punctuation, and other mechanics of style.Copy-editing symbols can not be used in digital editing because they are not supported on digital platforms such as track changes.",1
"For a publisher to hire copy editors to print a hard copy, make edits, and then make changes is no longer the most efficient process.",1
The position of copy editors is at risk because time demands quicker results which can be automated by software that catches grammatical errors.,1
Transferring the responsibility from human copy editors to digital software has been adopted by some publishing companies because it is available free of cost.,1
"Copy editors are still employed and needed for heavy editings, such as fact-checking and content organization, which is beyond the abilities of the software.",1
"Digital editing now requires copy editors to understand SEO, HTML, CSS, and RSS feeds, as well as Adobe Illustrator and Adobe Dreamweaver.",1

"Professional speechwriter Lawrence Bernstein writes:

Some clients have called with six months to spare, others with four hours to go; some want to meet up first, others want coaching afterwards; quite a few did everything by email and we’ve never even spoken.",1
"Instead, speechwriters often have a broad understanding of basic economics, political roles, and policy issues, which make them generalists who are able to ""translate"" complex economic and policy issues into a clear message for the general public.",1
"Instead, speechwriters often develop their speech writing skills by combining a general liberal arts education with a variety of work experience in politics, public administration, journalism, or a related field.",1
"Executive speechwriter Anthony Trendl writes:

Speechwriters specialize in a kind of writing that merges marketing, theater, public relations, sales, education and politics all in one presentation.",1
A speechwriter has to meet with the executive and the executive's senior staff to determine the broad framework of points or messages that the executive wants to cover in the speech.,1
"Then, the speechwriter does his or her own research on the topic to flesh out this framework with anecdotes and examples.",1
"The speechwriter will also consider the audience for the speech, which can range from a town-hall meeting of community leaders to an international leaders' forum.",1
"Then the speechwriter blends the points, themes, positions, and messages with his or her own research to create an ""informative, original and authentic speech"" for the executive.The speechwriter then presents a draft version of the speech to the executive and makes notes on any revisions or changes that are requested.",1
"If the speechwriter is familiar with the topic and the positions and style of the executive, only small changes may be needed.",1
"Other fictional characters that are speechwriters include Violet Evergarden from the anime, Violet Evergarden, who wrote for any client who requested her through the C.H.",1
"In journalism, a staff writer byline indicates that the author of the article is an employee of the periodical, as opposed to being an independent freelance writer.",1
"In Britain, staff writers may work in the office instead of traveling to cover a beat.In an advertising agency, copywriting is the main responsibility of staff writers.In television, a staff writer is the probationary, entry-level position in the ""writers room""; that is, the team that creates a television series.",1

Who is the intended audience?",1
"According to one expert, technical writers use six design strategies to plan and create technical communication: arrangement, emphasis, clarity, conciseness, tone, and ethos.",1
"When considering arrangement technical writers look at how to use headings, lists, charts, and images to increase usability.Emphasis
How a document displays important sections through prominence or intensity.",1
"When considering emphasis technical writers look at how they can show readers important sections, warning, useful tips, etc.",1
"Technical writers must consider all these design strategies to ensure the audience can easily use the documents.Tone
The sound or feel of a document.",1
"In addition to language choice, technical writers set the tone of technical communication through the use of spacing, images, typefaces, etc.Ethos

A Website content writer or web content writer is a person who specializes in providing relevant content for websites.,1
"Generally, a website content writer who has got this knowledge of SEO is also referred to as an SEO Content Writer.",1
A writer is a person who uses written words in different styles and techniques to communicate ideas.,1
"Writers produce different forms of literary art and creative writing such as novels, short stories, books, poetry, plays, screenplays, 
teleplays, songs, and essays as well as other reports and news articles that may be of interest to the public.",1
Writers' texts are published across a range of media.,1
"Skilled writers who are able to use language to express ideas well, often contribute significantly to the cultural content of a society.The term ""writer"" is also used elsewhere in the arts and music – such as songwriter or a screenwriter – but as a standalone ""writer"" normally refers to the creation of written language.",1
Some writers work from an oral tradition.,1
"Writers can produce material across a number of genres, fictional or non-fictional.",1

"Writers work professionally or non-professionally, that is, for payment or without payment and may be paid either in advance, or only after their work is published.",1
"The term writer is often used as a synonym of author, although the latter term has a somewhat broader meaning and is used to convey legal responsibility for a piece of writing, even if its composition is anonymous, unknown or collaborative.",1
"For example, a writer's work may be read privately or recited or performed in a play or film.",1
"The writer of a letter may include elements of criticism, biography, or journalism.",1
Writers may begin their career in one genre and change to another.,1

"A taxicab, also known as a taxi or a cab, is a type of vehicle for hire with a driver, used by a single passenger or small group of passengers, often for a non-shared ride.",1
A taxicab conveys passengers between locations of their choice.,1
"""Taxicab"" is a compound word formed from contractions of ""taximeter"" and ""cabriolet"".",1
"Gasoline-powered taxicabs began operating in Paris in 1899, in London in 1903, and in New York in 1907.",1
The New York taxicabs were initially imported from France by Harry N. Allen owner of the Allen-Kingston Motor Car Company.,1

"Such taxicabs are variously called accessible taxis, wheelchair- or wheelchair-accessible taxicabs, modified taxicabs, or ""maxicabs"".",1
Wheelchair taxicabs are most often specially modified vans or minivans.,1
"Some wheelchair taxicabs are capable of transporting only one wheelchair-using passenger at a time, and can usually accommodate 4 to 6 additional able-bodied passengers.",1
"Wheelchair taxicabs are part of the regular fleet in most cases, and so are not reserved exclusively for the use of wheelchair users.",1
"Taxicabs differ in other ways as well: London's black cabs have a large compartment beside the driver for storing bags, while many fleets of regular taxis also include wheelchair accessible taxicabs among their numbers.",1
"Although taxicabs have traditionally been sedans, minivans, hatchbacks and even SUV taxicabs are becoming increasingly common.",1
"Both taxicabs had female drivers and were branded under ZeRO TAXI livery.Hybrid taxis are becoming more and more common in Canada, with all new taxis in British Columbia being hybrids, or other fuel efficient vehicles, such as the Toyota Prius or Toyota Corolla.",1
Taxicab companies claimed they increased fares in order to make up for lost competition resulting from the increased supply of taxis.,1
Deregulation also resulted in decreased taxicab productivity and decreased taxi-company revenues.,1
Deregulation failed to increase taxicab ridership enough to compensate taxi companies for those losses.,1
"A chauffeur is a person employed to drive a passenger motor vehicle, especially a luxury vehicle such as a large sedan or limousine.",1
"Hence the term chauffeur which, in this context, means something like ""heater-upper"".",1
"The chauffeur would prime the hot tubes at the start of a journey, after which the natural compression cycle of the engine would keep them at the correct temperature.",1
"The chauffeur also maintained the car, including routine maintenance and cleaning, and had to be a skilled mechanic to deal with breakdowns and tyre punctures en route, which were very common in the earliest years of the automobile.",1
"People currently sometimes employ chauffeurs full-time to drive themselves in their own personal vehicles, yet there are also professional services offering limousines or rental cars driven by chauffeurs.",1
Chauffeurs may be taught proper etiquette for use when they are in presence of their clientele.,1

"However, there have been many pay drivers in top level series like Formula One, Champ Car, IndyCar Series, and the NASCAR Cup Series.",1
Teams willing to accept pay drivers are often at the back of the grid and struggling financially.,1
"While a pay driver often brings an infusion of much needed funding, their terms often require share ownership and/or influence in the team's operations.",1
They or other pay drivers like Giovanni Lavaggi and Jean-Denis Délétraz are usually associated with poorer performances compared to those with paid drives.,1
"Although occasionally pay driver are amongst labelled as ""unworthy"" for an F1 ride, many of the pay drivers in F1 today come with occasional success in their individual races in lower formulas.",1
Pay drivers are also common in stock car racing and are very prevalent in development series such as the Xfinity Series and ARCA Racing Series.,1
"There are also several pay drivers competing at the Cup level including Matt Tifft and Paul Menard, the son of home improvement tycoon John.",1
"Pay drivers were controversial in stock car racing if payments failed; an example would be in 2015, when Kyle Busch's Camping World Truck Series team, Kyle Busch Motorsports, sued former driver Justin Boston, a pay driver, and the sponsor for missed payments.There has also been a long history of pay drivers in Australian touring car racing.",1
NASCAR teams rarely have specific test drivers on staff.,1

Truck drivers are five times more likely to die in a work-related accident than the average worker.,1
The safety of truck drivers and their trucks is monitored and statistics compiled by the FMCSA or Federal Motor Carriers Safety Administration who provides online information on safety violations.,1
This suggests that the truck driver makes the same errors as the car driver and vice versa.,1
"Truck drivers often spend their nights parked at a truck stop, rest area, or on the shoulder of a freeway ramp.",1
"Among other things, a truck driver's DAC Report contains the driver's identification, the name and address of the contributing trucking company, the driver's dates of employment with that company, the driver's reason for leaving that company, whether the driver is eligible for rehire, and comments about the driver's work record (e.g.",1
"As long as truck drivers can be threatened with a false DAC report for standing up to management or leaving their company for a better job elsewhere, working conditions at truck driver jobs will not improve.",1
The average age of a truck driver is now 57.During February 2016 an independent survey on the driver shortage was carried out by a UK freight exchange.,1
"Truck drivers are even a high-risk group for HIV-infection in those countries.In order to address the hazards relative to driver fatigue, many countries have laws limiting the amount of time truck drivers can work.",1
"Factors that increase truck driver fatigue include lack of sleep, long work hours, sedentary lifestyle, poor diet, and general stress.",1
A contributing factor to truck driver fatigue is the stress associated with managing compliance to FMCSA's hours of service regulations.,1
Truck drivers are required to keep a HOS-compliant log.,1
Almost 90% of truck drivers exercise only sometimes or never and only 8% exercise regularly.,1
"Truck drivers also suffer from musculoskeletal disorders, cardiovascular disease, and stress at higher rates.",1
"Often older truck drivers speaking over their CB radios are frustrated at new-school truck drivers' lack of understanding of the trucking slang of the '60s, '70s and '80s, and grudgingly resort to standard English when communicating with them.",1
Truck drivers also use flashing headlights to warn drivers in the oncoming lane(s) of a police patrol down the road.,1

"Second, engineering research employs many semi-empirical methods that are foreign to pure scientific research, one example being the method of parameter variation.As stated by Fung et al.",1
"Although engineering solutions make use of scientific principles, engineers must also take into account safety, efficiency, economy, reliability, and constructability or ease of fabrication as well as the environment, ethical and legal considerations such as patent infringement or liability in the case of failure of the solution.",1
"Conversely, some engineering disciplines view the human body as a biological machine worth studying and are dedicated to emulating many of its functions by replacing biology with technology.",1
"Engineering management or ""Management engineering"" is a specialized field of management concerned with engineering practice or the engineering industry sector.",1
"During an engineering management course, students will develop industrial engineering skills, knowledge, and expertise, alongside knowledge of business administration, management techniques, and strategic thinking.",1
"This combination of technical engineering practice, management consulting practice, industry sector knowledge, and change management expertise enables professional engineers who are also qualified as management consultants to lead major business transformation initiatives.",1
Financial engineering has similarly borrowed the term.,1
"The scientific method soon played a greater role in knowledge creation and it was not until the 19th century that many of the institutional and professional features of science began to take shape; along with the changing of ""natural philosophy"" to ""natural science.",1
"Disciplines that use existing scientific knowledge for practical purposes, such as engineering and medicine, are described as applied sciences.Science is based on research, which is commonly conducted in academic and research institutions as well as in government agencies and companies.",1
"The practical impact of scientific research has led to the emergence of science policies that seek to influence the scientific enterprise by prioritizing the development of commercial products, armaments, health care, and environmental protection.",1
"Although some scientific research is applied research into specific problems, a great deal of our understanding comes from the curiosity-driven undertaking of basic research.",1
"Taken in its entirety, the scientific method allows for highly creative problem solving while minimizing any effects of subjective bias on the part of its users.",1
The belief that scientific theories should and do represent metaphysical reality is known as realism.,1
It views scientific theories as black boxes with only their input and output being relevant.,1
"He wrote that scientific knowledge ""consists in the search for truth,"" but it ""is not the search for certainty ... All human knowledge is fallible and therefore uncertain.New scientific knowledge rarely results in vast changes in our understanding.",1
"Therefore, scientists adhering to proper scientific approaches will doubt themselves even once they possess the truth.",1
"Scientific journals communicate and document the results of research carried out in universities and various other research institutions, serving as an archival record of science.",1
"The first scientific journals, Journal des Sçavans followed by the Philosophical Transactions, began publication in 1665.",1
"The term ""scientific misconduct"" refers to situations such as where researchers have intentionally misrepresented their published data or have purposely given credit for a discovery to the wrong person.",1

"Mechanical engineering is an engineering discipline that combines engineering physics and mathematics principles with materials science to design, analyze, manufacture, and maintain mechanical systems.",1
"The mechanical engineering field requires an understanding of core areas including mechanics, dynamics, thermodynamics, materials science, structural analysis, and electricity.",1
This allowed mechanical engineering to develop as a separate field within engineering.,1
Education in mechanical engineering has historically been based on a strong foundation in mathematics and science.,1
Mechanical engineering programs typically take four to five years of study and result in a Bachelor of Engineering (B.Eng.,1
"), Bachelor of Mechanical Engineering (B.M.E.",1
"Mechanical engineering programs in Canada are accredited by the Canadian Engineering Accreditation Board, and most other countries offering engineering degrees have similar accreditation societies.",1

"All mechanical engineering programs include multiple semesters of mathematical classes including calculus, and advanced mathematical concepts including differential equations, partial differential equations, linear algebra, abstract algebra, and differential geometry, among others.",1
"In addition to the core mechanical engineering curriculum, many mechanical engineering programs offer more specialized programs and classes, such as control systems, robotics, transport and logistics, cryogenics, fuel technology, automotive engineering, biomechanics, vibration, optics and others, if a separate department does not exist for these subjects.Most mechanical engineering programs also require varying amounts of research or community projects to gain practical problem-solving experience.",1
"As mechanical engineering begins to merge with other disciplines, as seen in mechatronics, multidisciplinary design optimization is being used with other CAE programs to automate and improve the iterative design process.",1
"Composite material research within mechanical engineering typically focuses on designing stronger or more rigid materials while attempting to reduce weight, susceptibility to corrosion, and other undesirable factors.",1
"Areas of current mechanical engineering research in nanotechnology include nanofilters, nanofilms, and nanostructures, among others.",1
Biomolecular engineering is the application of engineering principles and practices to the purposeful manipulation of molecules of biological origin.,1
"Biomolecular engineering was first defined in 1992 by the U.S. National Institutes of Health as research at the interface of chemical engineering and biology with an emphasis at the molecular level"".",1
"Although first defined as research, biomolecular engineering has since become an academic discipline and a field of engineering practice.",1
"Also, Biomolecular Engineering was a former name of the journal New Biotechnology.",1
"With the use of biomolecular engineering, the way our processors work can be manipulated in order to function in the same sense a biological cell work.",1
Biomolecular engineering has the potential to become one of the most important scientific disciplines because of its advancements in the analyses of gene expression patterns as well as the purposeful manipulation of many important biomolecules to improve functionality.,1
"Biomolecular engineering will produce new designs for therapeutic drugs and high-value biomolecules for treatment or prevention of cancers, genetic diseases, and other types of metabolic diseases.",1
This method includes the biomolecular engineering of a number of molecules to attain the desired primer sequence.,1
The most prominent biomolecular engineering technique seen in this primer design method is the initial bioimmobilization of a nucleotide to a solid support.,1
Another biomolecular engineering technique that is used in ELISA development is the bioconjugation of an enzyme to either an antibody or antigen depending on the type of ELISA.,1
Biomolecular engineering is a subset of Chemical Engineering that applies these same principles to the processing of chemical substances made by living organisms.,1
"According to ABET, biomolecular engineering curricula ""must provide thorough grounding in the basic sciences including chemistry, physics, and biology, with some content at an advanced level… [and] engineering application of these basic sciences to design, analysis, and control, of chemical, physical, and/or biological processes.""",1
"Biomolecules include large macromolecules such as proteins, carbohydrates, lipids, and nucleic acids, as well as small molecules such as primary metabolites, secondary metabolites and natural products.",1
"Biomolecules are usually endogenous, produced within the organism but organisms usually need exogenous biomolecules, for example certain nutrients, to survive.",1
"Most biomolecules are organic compounds, and just four elements—oxygen, carbon, hydrogen, and nitrogen—make up 96% of the human body's mass.",1
"Genetic engineering, also called genetic modification or genetic manipulation, is the direct manipulation of an organism's genes using biotechnology.",1
"Genetic engineering has been applied in numerous fields including research, medicine, industrial biotechnology and agriculture.",1
"However, some broad definitions of genetic engineering include selective breeding.",1
If genetic engineering is used to remove genetic material from the target organism the resulting organism is termed a knockout organism.,1
Genetic engineering as the direct manipulation of DNA by humans outside breeding and mutations has only existed since the 1970s.,1
"The term ""genetic engineering"" was first coined by Jack Williamson in his science fiction novel Dragon's Island, published in 1951 – one year before DNA's role in heredity was confirmed by Alfred Hershey and Martha Chase, and two years before James Watson and Francis Crick showed that the DNA molecule has a double-helix structure – though the general concept of direct genetic manipulation was explored in rudimentary form in Stanley G. Weinbaum's 1936 science fiction story Proteus Island.",1
"In 2017, genetic engineering of chimeric antigen receptors on a patient's own T-cells was approved by the U.S. FDA as a treatment for the cancer acute lymphoblastic leukemia.",1
Applications of genetic engineering in conservation are thus far mostly theoretical and have yet to be put into practice.,1
Genetic engineering is also being used to create microbial art.,1
"Genetic engineering methods are weakly represented in film; Michael Clark, writing for The Wellcome Trust, calls the portrayal of genetic engineering and biotechnology ""seriously distorted"" in films such as The 6th Day.",1
Immunology is a branch of biology that covers the study of immune systems in all organisms.,1
"Immunology charts, measures, and contextualizes the physiological functioning of the immune system in states of both health and diseases; malfunctions of the immune system in immunological disorders; and the physical, chemical, and physiological characteristics of the components of the immune system in vitro, in situ, and in vivo.",1
"Immunology has applications in numerous disciplines of medicine, particularly in the fields of organ transplantation, oncology, rheumatology, virology, bacteriology, parasitology, psychiatry, and dermatology.",1
Immunology rests on an understanding of the properties of these two biological entities and the cellular response to both.,1
The immunology concerned with physiological reaction characteristic of the immune state.,1
"RNA and DNA are nucleic acids, and, along with lipids, proteins and carbohydrates, constitute the four major macromolecules essential for all known forms of life.",1
"Like DNA, RNA is assembled as a chain of nucleotides, but unlike DNA, RNA is found in nature as a single strand folded onto itself, rather than a paired double strand.",1
Cellular organisms use messenger RNA to convey genetic information that directs synthesis of specific proteins.,1
"Some RNA molecules play an active role within cells by catalyzing biological reactions, controlling gene expression, or sensing and communicating responses to cellular signals.",1
"This process uses transfer RNA molecules to deliver amino acids to the ribosome, where ribosomal RNA then links amino acids together to form coded proteins.",1
Analysis of these RNAs has revealed that they are highly structured.,1
"In this fashion, RNAs can achieve chemical catalysis.",1
An important structural component of RNA that distinguishes it from DNA is the presence of a hydroxyl group at the 2' position of the ribose sugar.,1
"RNA is transcribed with only four bases, but these bases and attached sugars can be modified in numerous ways as the RNAs mature.",1
"Since RNA is charged, metal ions such as Mg2+ are needed to stabilise many secondary and tertiary structures.The naturally occurring enantiomer of RNA is D-RNA composed of D-ribonucleotides.",1
"L-RNA is much more stable against degradation by RNase.Like other structured biopolymers such as proteins, one can define topology of a folded RNA molecule.",1
"For instance, a number of RNA viruses use this type of enzyme to replicate their genetic material.",1
"Also, RNA-dependent RNA polymerase is part of the RNA interference pathway in many organisms.",1
The coding sequence of the mRNA determines the amino acid sequence in the protein that is produced.,1
"However, many RNAs do not code for protein.",1
"These so-called non-coding RNAs can be encoded by their own genes, but can also derive from mRNA introns.",1
"There are also non-coding RNAs involved in gene regulation, RNA processing and other roles.",1
"Certain RNAs are able to catalyse chemical reactions such as cutting and ligating other RNA molecules, and the catalysis of peptide bond formation in the ribosome; these are known as ribozymes.",1

"The mRNA is then exported from the nucleus to the cytoplasm, where it is bound to ribosomes and translated into its corresponding protein form with the help of tRNA.",1
"Eukaryotic ribosomes contain four different rRNA molecules: 18S, 5.8S, 28S and 5S rRNA.",1
"Three of the rRNA molecules are synthesized in the nucleolus, and one is synthesized elsewhere.",1
"In the cytoplasm, ribosomal RNA and protein combine to form a nucleoprotein called a ribosome.",1
The ribosome binds mRNA and carries out protein synthesis.,1
Nearly all the RNA found in a typical eukaryotic cell is rRNA.,1
Transfer-messenger RNA is found in many bacteria and plastids.,1
It tags proteins encoded by mRNAs that lack stop codons for degradation and prevents the ribosome from stalling.,1
"More recently, RNAs have been found to regulate genes as well.",1
"There are several kinds of RNA-dependent processes in eukaryotes regulating the expression of genes at various points, such as RNAi repressing genes post-transcriptionally,  long non-coding RNAs shutting down blocks of chromatin epigenetically, and enhancer RNAs inducing increased gene expression.",1
Bacterial small RNA and the CRISPR system are examples of such prokaryotic regulatory RNA systems.,1
"Additional lncRNAs, currently defined as RNAs of more than 200 base pairs that do not appear to have coding potential, have been found associated with regulation of stem cell pluripotency and cell division.",1
"Bacterial small RNAs generally act via antisense pairing with mRNA to down-regulate its translation, either by affecting stability or affecting cis-binding ability.",1
They are cis-acting regulatory RNA sequences acting allosterically.,1
"Introns are spliced out of pre-mRNA by spliceosomes, which contain several small nuclear RNAs, or the introns can be ribozymes that are spliced by themselves.",1
"RNA can also be altered by having its nucleotides modified to  nucleotides other than A, C, G and U.",1
"In eukaryotes, modifications of RNA nucleotides are in general directed by small nucleolar RNAs, found in the nucleolus and cajal bodies.",1
snoRNAs associate with enzymes and guide them to a spot on an RNA by basepairing to that RNA.,1
"rRNAs and tRNAs are extensively modified, but snRNAs and mRNAs can also be the target of base modification.",1
RNA viruses have genomes composed of RNA that encodes a number of proteins.,1
dsRNA forms the genetic material of some viruses.,1
"Double-stranded RNA, such as viral RNA or siRNA, can trigger RNA interference in eukaryotes, as well as interferon response in vertebrates.",1
circular form of RNA expressed throughout the animal and plant kingdom.,1
"circRNAs are thought to arise via a ""back-splice"" reaction where the spliceosome joins a downstream donor to an upstream acceptor splice site.",1
"So far the function of circRNAs is largely unknown, although for few examples a microRNA sponging activity has been demonstrated.",1
The role of RNA in protein synthesis was suspected already in 1939.,1
"Catalytic RNA molecules were discovered in the early 1980s, leading to a 1989 Nobel award to Thomas Cech and Sidney Altman.",1
"Studies on RNA interference gleaned a Nobel Prize for Andrew Fire and Craig Mello in 2006, and another Nobel was awarded for studies on the transcription of RNA to Roger Kornberg in the same year.",1

"Precious metals were historically used as coinage, but in the modern era, coinage metals have extended to at least 23 of the chemical elements.The history of refined metals is thought to begin with the use of copper about 11,000 years ago.",1
"Sheets of metal thicker than a few micrometres appear opaque, but gold leaf transmits green light.",1
"The strength of metallic bonds for different elemental metals reaches a maximum around the center of the transition metal series, as these elements have large numbers of delocalized electrons.Although most elemental metals have higher densities than most nonmetals, there is a wide variation in their densities, lithium being the least dense and osmium the most dense.",1
"Metals are typically malleable and ductile, deforming under stress without cleaving.",1
The nondirectional nature of metallic bonding is thought to contribute significantly to the ductility of most metallic solids.,1

"The atoms of metallic substances are typically arranged in one of three common crystal structures, namely body-centered cubic, face-centered cubic, and hexagonal close-packed.",1
Some metals adopt different structures depending on the temperature.,1
"Consequently, semiconductors and nonmetals are relatively poor conductors.",1
The elemental metals have electrical conductivity values of from 6.9 × 103 S/cm for manganese to 6.3 × 105 S/cm for silver.,1
"In contrast, a semiconducting metalloid such as boron has an electrical conductivity 1.5 × 10−6 S/cm.",1
"With one exception, metallic elements reduce their electrical conductivity when heated.",1
Metals are relatively good conductors of heat.,1
The electrons in a metal's electron cloud are highly mobile and easily able to pass on heat-induced vibrational energy.,1
"The contribution of a metal's electrons to its heat capacity and thermal conductivity, and the electrical conductivity of the metal itself can be calculated from the free electron model.",1
"The oxides of metals are generally basic, as opposed to those of nonmetals, which are acidic or neutral.",1
"Painting, anodizing or plating metals are good ways to prevent their corrosion.",1
"However, a more reactive metal in the electrochemical series must be chosen for coating, especially when chipping of the coating is expected.",1
"Water and the two metals form an electrochemical cell, and if the coating is less reactive than the underlying metal, the coating actually promotes corrosion.",1
The remaining elements are either metalloids or nonmetals.,1
"Most pure metals are either too soft, brittle or chemically reactive for practical use.",1
Combining different ratios of metals as alloys modifies the properties of pure metals to produce desirable characteristics.,1
"Of all the metallic alloys in use today, the alloys of iron make up the largest proportion both by quantity and commercial value.",1
"Other significant metallic alloys are those of aluminium, titanium, copper and magnesium.",1
The Metallic elements table in this section categorises the elemental metals on the basis of their chemical properties into alkali and alkaline earth metals; transition and post-transition metals; and lanthanides and actinides.,1
"For example, the ferromagnetic metals—those metals that are magnetic at room temperature—are iron, cobalt, and nickel.",1
"Ferrous metals are often magnetic, but not exclusively.",1

The term noble metal is commonly used in opposition to base metal.,1
"Noble metals are resistant to corrosion or oxidation, unlike most base metals.",1
"They tend to be precious metals, often due to perceived rarity.",1
"Chemically, the precious metals are less reactive than most elements, have high luster and high electrical conductivity.",1
"Historically, precious metals were important as currency, but are now regarded mainly as investment and industrial commodities.",1
The best-known precious metals are gold and silver.,1
"Other precious metals include the platinum group metals: ruthenium, rhodium, palladium, osmium, iridium, and platinum, of which platinum is the most widely traded.",1

Nonmetals make up the rest of the crust.,1
Metals are primarily found as lithophiles or chalcophiles.,1
"Lithophile metals are mainly the s-block elements, the more reactive of the d-block elements.",1
"Chalcophile metals are mainly the less reactive d-block elements, and the period 4–6 p-block metals.",1

"These metals otherwise occur in the crust, in small quantities, chiefly as chalcophiles.The rotating fluid outer core of the Earth's interior, which is composed mostly of iron, is thought to be the source of Earth's protective magnetic field.",1
"Pyrometallurgy uses high temperatures to convert ore into raw metals, while hydrometallurgy employs aqueous chemistry for the same purpose.",1
"When a metal ore is an ionic compound of that metal and a non-metal, the ore must usually be smelted—heated with a reducing agent—to extract the pure metal.",1
"Many common metals, such as iron, are smelted using carbon as a reducing agent.",1
"Some metals, such as aluminium and sodium, have no commercially practical reducing agent, and are extracted using electrolysis instead.Sulfide ores are not reduced directly to the metal but are roasted in air to convert them to oxides.",1
"Iron, a heavy metal, may be the most common as it accounts for 90% of all refined metals; aluminium, a light metal, is the next most commonly refined metal.",1
"Some metals and metal alloys possess high structural strength per unit mass, making them useful materials for carrying large loads or resisting impact damage.",1
"Metal alloys can be engineered to have high resistance to shear, torque and deformation.",1
However the same metal can also be vulnerable to fatigue damage through repeated use or from sudden stress failure when a load capacity is exceeded.,1
"The strength and resilience of metals has led to their frequent use in high-rise building and bridge construction, as well as most vehicles, many appliances, tools, pipes, and railroad tracks.",1
"Metals are good conductors, making them valuable in electrical appliances and for carrying an electric current over a distance with little energy lost.",1
Electrical power grids rely on metal cables to distribute electricity.,1
The thermal conductivity of metals is useful for containers to heat materials over a flame.,1
Metals are also used for heat sinks to protect sensitive equipment from overheating.,1

The metal workers involved heated gold with grains of the platinum alloy until the gold melted at which point the platinum group metals became bound within the gold.,1
"Metallic zinc, which is brittle if impure, was isolated in India by 1300 AD.",1
The lanthanide metals were largely regarded as oddities until the 1960s when methods were developed to more efficiently separate them from one another.,1
"Other metals discovered and prepared during this time were cobalt, nickel, manganese, molybdenum, tungsten, and chromium; and some of the platinum group metals, palladium, osmium, iridium, and rhodium.",1
"From 1809 onwards, light metals such as sodium, potassium, and strontium were isolated.",1
"They behaved chemically as metals however, and were subsequently recognised as such.",1
The most common metal in use for electric power transmission today is aluminium conductor steel reinforced.,1
While pure metallic titanium was first prepared in 1910 it was not used outside the laboratory until 1932.,1
Metallic scandium was produced for the first time in 1937.,1
"Metallurgists of the 19th century were unable to produce the combination of low carbon and high chromium found in most modern stainless steels, and the high-chromium alloys they could produce were too brittle to be practical.",1
Its status as a metal or a nonmetal—or something else—is not yet clear.,1
"Most pure and alloyed metals, in their solid state, have atoms arranged in a highly ordered crystalline structure.",1
Amorphous metals have a non-crystalline glass-like structure.,1

"Ceramic engineering is the science and technology of creating objects from inorganic, non-metallic materials.",1
"Ceramic engineering, like many sciences, evolved from a different discipline by today's standards.",1
"The crystallinity of ceramic materials ranges from highly oriented to semi-crystalline, vitrified, and often completely amorphous.",1
"In the 20th century, new ceramic materials were developed for use in advanced ceramic engineering, such as in semiconductors.",1
"Ceramic materials are brittle, hard, strong in compression, and weak in shearing and tension.",1
"The modern ceramic materials, which are classified as advanced ceramics, include silicon carbide and tungsten carbide.",1
"Ceramic materials are usually ionic or covalent bonded materials, and can be crystalline or amorphous.",1
"Other ceramic materials, generally requiring greater purity in their make-up than those above, include forms of several chemical compounds, including:

Barium titanate displays ferroelectricity, meaning that its mechanical, electrical, and thermal responses are coupled to one another and also history-dependent.",1
"Ultimately, these ceramic materials may be used as bone replacements or with the incorporation of protein collagens, synthetic bones.",1
Durable actinide-containing ceramic materials have many applications such as in nuclear fuels for burning excess Pu and in chemically-inert sources of alpha irradiation for power supply of unmanned space vehicles or to produce electricity for microelectronic devices.,1
"Polymer engineering is generally an engineering field that designs, analyses, and modifies polymer materials.",1
"Polymer engineering covers aspects of the petrochemical industry, polymerization, structure and characterization of polymers, properties of polymers, compounding and processing of polymers and description of major polymers, structure property relations and applications.",1
"A polymer is a large molecule, or macromolecule, composed of many repeated subunits.",1
Polymers range from familiar synthetic plastics such as polystyrene to natural biopolymers such as DNA and proteins that are fundamental to biological structure and function.,1
"Polymers, both natural and synthetic, are created via polymerization of many small molecules, known as monomers.",1
The terms polymer and resin are often synonymous with plastic.,1
"The term ""polymer"" derives from the Greek word πολύς and μέρος, and refers to a molecule whose structure is composed of multiple repeating units, from which originates a characteristic of high relative molecular mass and attendant properties.",1
"The units composing polymers derive, actually or conceptually, from molecules of low relative molecular mass.",1
"The modern concept of polymers as covalently bonded macromolecular structures was proposed in 1920 by Hermann Staudinger, who spent the next decade finding experimental evidence for this hypothesis.Polymers are studied in the fields of biophysics and macromolecular science, and polymer science.",1
"Natural polymeric materials such as hemp, shellac, amber, wool, silk, and natural rubber have been used for centuries.",1
"A variety of other natural polymers exist, such as cellulose, which is the main constituent of wood and paper.",1
"The list of synthetic polymers, roughly in order of worldwide demand, includes polyethylene, polypropylene, polystyrene, polyvinyl chloride, synthetic rubber, phenol formaldehyde resin, neoprene, nylon, polyacrylonitrile, PVB, silicone, and many more.",1
"During the polymerization process, some chemical groups may be lost from each monomer.",1
This happens in the polymerization of PET polyester.,1
"Newer methods, such as plasma polymerization do not fit neatly into either category.",1
Synthetic polymerization reactions may be carried out with or without a catalyst.,1
"Laboratory synthesis of biopolymers, especially of proteins, is an area of intensive research.",1
"There are other biopolymers such as rubber, suberin, melanin, and lignin.",1
Many commercially important polymers are synthesized by chemical modification of naturally occurring polymers.,1
"Ways in which polymers can be modified include oxidation, cross-linking, and endcapping.",1
Especially in the production of polymers the gas separation by membranes has acquired increasing importance in the petrochemical industry and is now a relatively well-established unit operation.,1
"The process of polymer degassing is necessary to suit polymer for extrusion and pelletizing, increasing safety, environmental, and product quality aspects.",1
Polymer nomenclature is generally based upon the type of monomer residues comprising the polymer.,1
"A polymer which contains only a single type of repeat unit is known as a homopolymer, while a polymer containing two or more types of repeat units is known as a copolymer.",1
"A terpolymer is a copolymer which contains three types of repeat units.Polystyrene is composed only of styrene-based repeat units, and is classified as a homopolymer.",1
"Some biological polymers are composed of a variety of different but structurally related monomer residues; for example, polynucleotides such as DNA are composed of four types of nucleotide subunits.",1
A polymer molecule containing ionizable subunits is known as a polyelectrolyte or ionomer.,1
These are the elements of polymer structure that require the breaking of a covalent bond in order to change.,1
Various polymer structures can be produced depending on the monomers and reaction conditions: A polymer may consist of linear macromolecules containing each only one unbranched chain.,1
"While branched and unbranched polymers are usually thermoplastics, many elastomers have a wide-meshed cross-linking between the ""main chains"".",1
Highly branched polymers are amorphous and the molecules in the solid interact randomly.,1
A branched polymer molecule is composed of a main chain with one or more substituent side chains or branches.,1
"Types of branched polymers include star polymers, comb polymers, polymer brushes, dendronized polymers, ladder polymers, and dendrimers.",1
There exist also two-dimensional polymers which are composed of topologically planar repeat units.,1
"A polymer's architecture affects many of its physical properties including solution viscosity, melt viscosity, solubility in various solvents, glass transition temperature and the size of individual polymer coils in solution.",1
"As with other molecules, a polymer's size may also be expressed in terms of molecular weight.",1
"Since synthetic polymerization techniques typically yield a statistical distribution of chain lengths, the molecular weight is expressed in terms of weighted averages.",1
Alternating copolymers possess two regularly alternating monomer residues: [AB]n. An example is the equimolar copolymer of styrene and maleic anhydride formed by free-radical chain-growth polymerization.,1
"A step-growth copolymer such as Nylon 66 can also be considered a strictly alternating copolymer of diamine and diacid residues, but is often described as a homopolymer with the dimeric residue of one amine and one acid as a repeat unit.",1
Periodic copolymers have more than two species of monomer units in a regular sequence.,1
Statistical copolymers have monomer residues arranged according to a statistical rule.,1
A statistical copolymer in which the probability of finding a particular type of monomer residue at a particular point in the chain is independent of the types of surrounding monomer residue may be referred to as a truly random copolymer.,1
"For example, the chain-growth copolymer of vinyl chloride and vinyl acetate is random.",1
Block copolymers have long sequences of different monomer units.,1
"Polymers with two or three blocks of two distinct chemical species are called diblock copolymers and triblock copolymers, respectively.",1
"Polymers with three blocks, each of a different chemical species are termed triblock terpolymers.",1
Graft or grafted copolymers contain side chains or branches whose repeat units have a different composition or configuration than the main chain.,1
A copolymer containing a controlled arrangement of monomers is called a sequence-controlled polymer.,1
"Alternating, periodic and block copolymers are simple examples of sequence-controlled polymers.",1
"Disordered polymers: In the solid state, atactic polymers, polymers with a high degree of branching and random copolymers form amorphous.",1
"In melt and solution, polymers tend to form a constantly changing ""statistical cluster"", see freely-jointed-chain model.",1
"In simple polymers, the chains are present in the crystal in zigzag conformation.",1
"Block copolymers in which a hard segment of the polymer has a tendency to crystallize and a soft segment has an amorphous structure are one type of thermoplastic elastomers: the hard segments ensure wide-meshed, physical crosslinking.",1
"A synthetic polymer may be loosely described as crystalline if it contains regions of three-dimensional ordering on atomic length scales, usually arising from intramolecular folding or stacking of adjacent chains.",1
Synthetic polymers may consist of both crystalline and amorphous regions; the degree of crystallinity may be expressed in terms of a weight fraction or volume fraction of crystalline material.,1
Few synthetic polymers are entirely crystalline.,1
"The crystallinity of polymers is characterized by their degree of crystallinity, ranging from zero for a completely non-crystalline polymer to one for a theoretical completely crystalline polymer.",1
Polymers with microcrystalline regions are generally tougher and more impact-resistant than totally amorphous polymers.,1
"Polymers with a degree of crystallinity approaching zero or one will tend to be transparent, while polymers with intermediate degrees of crystallinity will tend to be opaque due to light scattering by crystalline or glassy regions.",1
"For many polymers, reduced crystallinity may also be associated with increased transparency.",1
"Semi-crystalline polymers can undergo crystallization and melting transitions, whereas amorphous polymers do not.",1
"In polymers, crystallization and melting do not suggest solid-liquid phase transitions, as in the case of water or other molecular fluids.",1
"Since polymeric molecules are much larger and hence generally have much higher specific volumes than small molecules, the number of molecules involved in a polymeric mixture is far smaller than the number in a small molecule mixture of equal volume.",1
"Furthermore, the phase behavior of polymer solutions and mixtures is more complex than that of small molecule mixtures.",1
"In a good solvent, the polymer appears swollen and occupies a large volume.",1
"Under the theta condition, the polymer behaves like an ideal random coil.",1
"Because polymer chains are so long, these interchain forces are amplified far beyond the attractions between conventional molecules.",1

"The main objectives of earthquake engineering are:

Foresee the potential consequences of strong earthquakes on urban areas and civil infrastructure.",1
"Basic concepts of the earthquake engineering, implemented in the major building codes, assume that a building should survive a rare, very severe earthquake by sustaining significant damage but without globally collapsing.",1
The Earthquake Engineering Research Institute is a leader in dissemination of earthquake engineering research related information both in the U.S. and globally.,1
A definitive list of earthquake engineering research related shaking tables around the world may be found in Experimental Facilities for Earthquake Engineering Simulation Worldwide.,1
Seismic loading is one of the basic concepts of earthquake engineering which means application of an earthquake-generated agitation to a structure.,1
"Seismic loading depends, primarily, on:

Anticipated earthquake's parameters at the site - known as seismic hazard
Geotechnical parameters of the site
Structure's parameters
Characteristics of the anticipated gravity waves from tsunami.Sometimes, seismic load exceeds ability of a structure to resist it without being broken, partially or completely  Due to their mutual interaction, seismic loading and seismic performance of a structure are intimately related.",1
"Wind engineering is a subset of mechanical engineering, structural engineering, meteorology, and applied physics that analyzes the effects of wind in the natural and the built environment and studies the possible damage, inconvenience or benefits which may result from wind.",1
"Wind engineering draws upon meteorology, fluid dynamics, mechanics, geographic information systems and a number of specialist engineering disciplines including aerodynamics, and structural dynamics.",1
"Wind engineering involves, among other topics:

Wind impact on structures.",1
Air pollution near buildings.Wind engineering may be considered by structural engineers to be closely related to earthquake engineering and explosion protection.,1
"The term ""Wind Engineering"" was first coined in 1970.",1
So wind engineering is essential for the analysis and design of tall buildings.,1
Wind is the flow of gases on a large scale.,1
"In outer space, solar wind is the movement of gases or charged particles from the Sun through space, while planetary wind is the outgassing of light chemical elements from a planet's atmosphere into space.",1
"Winds are commonly classified by their spatial scale, their speed, the types of forces that cause them, the regions in which they occur, and their effect.",1
The strongest observed winds on a planet in the Solar System occur on Neptune and Saturn.,1
Winds have various aspects: velocity; the density of the gas involved; energy content or wind energy.,1
The wind is also an important means of transportation for seeds and small birds; with time things can travel thousands of miles in the wind.,1
"In meteorology, winds are often referred to according to their strength, and the direction from which the wind is blowing.",1
Short bursts of high speed wind are termed gusts.,1
Strong winds of intermediate duration are termed squalls.,1
"Long-duration winds have various names associated with their average strength, such as breeze, gale, storm, and hurricane.",1
"Wind occurs on a range of scales, from thunderstorm flows lasting tens of minutes, to local breezes generated by heating of land surfaces and lasting a few hours, to global winds resulting from the difference in absorption of solar energy between the climate zones on Earth.",1

"When winds become strong, trees and human-made structures are damaged or destroyed.",1
"Winds can shape landforms, via a variety of aeolian processes such as the formation of fertile soils, such as loess, and by erosion.",1
Wind also affects the spread of wildfires.,1
"Winds can disperse seeds from various plants, enabling the survival and dispersal of those plant species, as well as flying insect populations.",1
"Wind affects animals' food stores, as well as their hunting and defensive strategies.",1
Surface friction also causes winds to blow more inward into low-pressure areas.Winds defined by an equilibrium of physical forces are used in the decomposition and analysis of wind profiles.,1
The geostrophic wind component is the result of the balance between Coriolis force and pressure gradient force.,1
The thermal wind is the difference in the geostrophic wind between two levels in the atmosphere.,1
"The ageostrophic wind component is the difference between actual and geostrophic wind, which is responsible for air ""filling up"" cyclones over time.",1
The gradient wind is similar to the geostrophic wind but also includes centrifugal force.,1
"For example, a northerly wind blows from the north to the south.",1
"At airports, windsocks indicate wind direction, and can also be used to estimate wind speed by the angle of hang.",1

"Wind engineering describes the study of the effects of the wind on the built environment, including buildings, bridges and other man-made objects.",1
"Within the Beaufort scale, gale-force winds lie between 28 knots and 55 knots with preceding adjectives such as moderate, fresh, strong, and whole used to differentiate the wind's strength within the gale category.",1
A storm has winds of 56 knots to 63 knots.,1
"The wind barb shows the speed using ""flags"" on the end.",1
"Therefore, a northeast wind will be depicted with a line extending from the cloud circle to the northeast, with flags indicating wind speed on the northeast end of this line.",1
"In a realistic wind turbine, this is impossible, as the captured air must also leave the turbine.",1
The strongest winds are in the mid-latitudes where cold polar air meets warm air from the tropics.,1
The trade winds blow predominantly from the northeast in the Northern Hemisphere and from the southeast in the Southern Hemisphere.,1
The trade winds act as the steering flow for tropical cyclones that form over the world's oceans.,1
"Trade winds also steer African dust westward across the Atlantic Ocean into the Caribbean, as well as portions of southeast North America.A monsoon is a seasonal prevailing wind that lasts for several months within tropical regions.",1
"These prevailing winds blow from the west to the east, and steer extratropical cyclones in this general manner.",1
The winds are predominantly from the southwest in the Northern Hemisphere and from the northwest in the Southern Hemisphere.,1
"The strongest westerly winds in the middle latitudes are within a band known as the Roaring Forties, between 40 and 50 degrees latitude south of the equator.",1
"Unlike the Westerlies, these prevailing winds blow from the east to the west, and are often weak and irregular.",1
"When large-scale winds are calm, the strength of the sea breeze is directly proportional to the temperature difference between the landmass and the sea.",1
"If an offshore wind of 8 knots exists, the sea breeze is not likely to develop.",1
"Wind direction also changes because of the contour of the land.If there is a pass in the mountain range, winds will rush through the pass with considerable speed because of the Bernoulli principle that describes an inverse relationship between speed and pressure.",1
Cool winds accelerating through mountain gaps have been given regional names.,1
"In Europe, similar winds are known as the Bora, Tramontane, and Mistral.",1
"When these winds blow over open waters, they increase mixing of the upper layers of the ocean that elevates cool, nutrient rich waters to the surface, which leads to increased marine life.In mountainous areas, local distortion of the airflow becomes severe.",1
"Orographic precipitation occurs on the windward side of mountains and is caused by the rising air motion of a large-scale flow of moist air across the mountain ridge, also known as upslope flow, resulting in adiabatic cooling and condensation.",1
Winds that flow over mountains down into lower elevations are known as downslope winds.,1
These winds are warm and dry.,1
"In Europe downwind of the Alps, they are known as foehn.",1
"Downslope winds also occur in the foothills of the Appalachian mountains of the United States, and they can be as strong as other downslope winds  and unusual compared to other foehn winds in that the relative humidity typically changes little due to the increased moisture in the source air mass.",1
"In California, downslope winds are funneled through mountain passes, which intensify their effect, and examples include the Santa Ana and sundowner winds.",1
Wind speeds during downslope wind effect can exceed 160 kilometers per hour.,1
"In addition, the wind speed also increases with the altitude.",1
It takes into account wind velocity and mass.,1
"Although wind produced only about 1.5% of worldwide electricity use in 2009, it is growing rapidly, having doubled in the three years between 2005 and 2008.",1
"In 2011 wind energy was also used to power the longest journey in a wind-powered car which travelled a distance of 5,000 km from Perth to Melbourne in Australia.",1
"Wind shear can be broken down into vertical and horizontal components, with horizontal wind shear seen across weather fronts and near the coast, and vertical shear typically near the surface, though also at higher levels in the atmosphere near upper level jets and frontal zones aloft.Wind shear itself is a microscale meteorological phenomenon occurring over a very small distance, but it can be associated with mesoscale or synoptic scale weather features such as squall lines and cold fronts.",1
"Wind shear has a significant effect on the control of aircraft during take-off and landing, and was a significant cause of aircraft accidents involving large loss of life within the United States.Sound movement through the atmosphere is affected by wind shear, which can bend the wave front, causing sounds to be heard where they normally would not, or vice versa.",1
"Strong vertical wind shear within the troposphere also inhibits tropical cyclone development, but helps to organize individual thunderstorms into living longer life cycles that can then produce severe weather.",1
"The thermal wind concept explains how differences in wind speed with height are dependent on horizontal temperature differences, and explains the existence of the jet stream.",1
"The Greek wind gods include Boreas, Notus, Eurus, and Zephyrus.",1
Fūjin is the Japanese wind god and is one of the eldest Shinto gods.,1
"Protestant Wind is a name for the storm that deterred the Spanish Armada from an invasion of England in 1588 where the wind played a pivotal role, or the favorable winds that enabled William of Orange to invade England in 1688.",1
"The velocity of surface wind is generally the primary factor governing the direction of flight operations at an airport, and airfield runways are aligned to account for the common wind direction(s) of the local area.",1
"While taking off with a tailwind may be necessary under certain circumstances, a headwind is generally desirable.",1
A tailwind increases takeoff distance required and decreases the climb gradient.,1
A rudimentary windmill was used to power an organ in the first century CE.,1
"The first practical windmills were later built in Sistan, Afghanistan, from the 7th century CE.",1
"These were vertical-axle windmills, which had long vertical driveshafts with rectangle shaped blades.",1
"Horizontal-axle windmills were later used extensively in Northwestern Europe to grind flour beginning in the 1180s, and many Dutch windmills still exist.",1
High altitude wind power is the focus of over 30 companies worldwide using tethered technology rather than ground-hugging compressive-towers.,1
"In gliding, wind gradients just above the surface affect the takeoff and landing phases of flight of a glider.",1
"Wind gradient can have a noticeable effect on ground launches, also known as winch launches or wire launches.",1
"If the wind gradient is significant or sudden, or both, and the pilot maintains the same pitch attitude, the indicated airspeed will increase, possibly exceeding the maximum ground launch tow speed.",1
"When landing, wind shear is also a hazard, particularly when the winds are strong.",1
The pilot must anticipate the wind gradient and use a higher approach speed to compensate for it.,1
"The general wind circulation moves small particulates such as dust across wide oceans thousands of kilometers downwind of their point of origin, which is known as deflation.",1
Westerly winds in the mid-latitudes of the planet drive the movement of ocean currents from west to east across the world's oceans.,1
"Wind has a very important role in aiding plants and other immobile organisms in dispersal of seeds, spores, pollen, etc.",1
"Although wind is not the primary form of seed dispersal in plants, it provides dispersal for a large percentage of the biomass of land plants.",1
"First, wind causes small particles to be lifted and therefore moved to another region.",1
"Wind erosion generally occurs in areas with little or no vegetation, often in areas where there is insufficient rainfall to support vegetation.",1
"Therefore, windbreaks are often planted by farmers to reduce the wind erosion of loess.",1
"Wind dispersal can take on one of two primary forms: seeds can float on the breeze or alternatively, they can flutter to the ground.",1
An important constraint on wind dispersal is the need for abundant seed production to maximize the likelihood of a seed landing in a site suitable for germination.,1
Reliance upon wind dispersal is common among many weedy or ruderal species.,1
Unusual mechanisms of wind dispersal include tumbleweeds.,1
"High winds scour away thin soils through erosion, as well as damage limbs and twigs.",1
"When high winds knock down or uproot trees, the process is known as windthrow.",1
"This is most likely on windward slopes of mountains, with severe cases generally occurring to tree stands that are 75 years or older.",1
Strong winds will pick up loose sand and topsoil and hurl it through the air at speeds ranging from 25 miles per hour to 40 miles per hour.,1
"Such windblown sand causes extensive damage to plant seedlings because it ruptures plant cells, making them vulnerable to evaporation and drought.",1
"Cockroaches use slight winds that precede the attacks of potential predators, such as toads, to survive their encounters.",1
Increases in wind above 15 kilometers per hour signals glaucous gulls to increase their foraging and aerial attacks on thick-billed murres.,1
Even a soft wind will cause a low level of environmental noise.,1
"If the wind is blowing harder, it may produce howling sounds of varying frequencies.",1
Wind pressures are positive on the windward side of a structure and negative on the leeward side.,1
Infrequent wind gusts can cause poorly designed suspension bridges to sway.,1
"When wind gusts are at a similar frequency to the swaying of the bridge, the bridge can be destroyed more easily, such as what occurred with the Tacoma Narrows Bridge in 1940.",1
Wind speeds as low as 23 knots can lead to power outages due to tree branches disrupting the flow of energy through power lines.,1
"Hurricane-force winds cause substantial damage to mobile homes, and begin to structurally damage homes with foundations.",1
Winds of this strength due to downsloped winds off terrain have been known to shatter windows and sandblast paint from cars.,1
"Once winds exceed 135 knots, homes completely collapse, and significant damage is done to larger buildings.",1
The most powerful gusts of wind on Earth were created by nuclear detonations.,1
Wildfires are fanned by these winds and often follow the air currents over hills and through valleys.,1
"Similar to the solar wind, the planetary wind is composed of light gases that escape planetary atmospheres.",1
The fastest wind ever recorded is coming from the accretion disc of the IGR J17091-3624 black hole.,1

"On Jupiter, wind speeds of 100 meters per second are common in zonal jet streams.",1
Saturn's winds are among the Solar System's fastest.,1
Cassini–Huygens data indicated peak easterly winds of 375 meters per second.,1
"On Uranus, northern hemisphere wind speeds reach as high as 240 meters per second near 50 degrees north latitude.",1
"The fastest wind on any known planet is on HD 80606 b located 190 light years away, where it blows at more than 11,000 mph or 5 km/s.",1
"""The built environment encompasses places and spaces created or modified by people to serve their needs of accommodation, organisation and representation.",1
"The sciences of the built environment cover architecture, urbanism, building technology, civil engineering, landscaping and the management of built stock mutations and operations.",1
"Studies have shown that built environments that were expressly designed to improve physical activity are linked to higher rates of physical activity, which in turn, positively affects health.",1

"Architectural engineering, also known as building engineering or architecture engineering, is an engineering discipline that deals with the technological aspects and multi-disciplinary approach to planning, design, construction and operation of buildings, such as analysis and integrated design of environmental systems, structural systems, behavior and properties of building components and materials, and construction management.From reduction of greenhouse gas emissions to the construction of resilient buildings, architectural engineers are at the forefront of addressing several major challenges of the 21st century.",1
Architectural engineering as a relatively new licensed profession emerged in the 20th century as a result of the rapid technological developments.,1
"Architectural engineering technology graduates, with applied engineering skills, often gain further learning with an MS degree in engineering and/or NAAB-accredited Masters of Architecture to become licensed as both an engineer and architect.",1
"Formal architectural engineering education, following the engineering model of earlier disciplines, developed in the late 19th century, and became widespread in the United States by the mid-20th century.",1
"Architectural engineering includes the design of building systems including heating, ventilation and air conditioning, plumbing, fire protection, electrical, lighting, architectural acoustics, and structural systems.",1
"Offshore construction is the installation of structures and facilities in a marine environment, usually for the production and transmission of electricity, oil, gas and other resources.",1
Other key factors in offshore construction are the weather window which defines periods of relatively light weather during which continuous construction or other offshore activity can take place.,1
"Diving bells in offshore construction are mainly used in water depths greater than 120 feet, less than that, the divers use a metal basket driven from an ""A"" frame from the deck.",1
"Offshore construction includes foundations engineering, structural design, construction, and/or repair of offshore structures, both commercial and military, including: 

Subsea oil and gas developments
Offshore platforms – fixed platforms, semi-submersibles, spars, tension leg platforms, floating production storage and offloading, etc.",1

"Highway engineering is an engineering discipline branching from civil engineering that involves the planning, design, construction, operation, and maintenance of roads, bridges, and tunnels to ensure safe and effective transportation of people and goods.",1
Highway engineering became prominent towards the latter half of the 20th Century after World War II.,1
Standards of highway engineering are continuously being improved.,1
"In the US, highway engineering became an important discipline with the passing of the Federal-Aid Highway Act of 1944, which aimed to connect 90% of cities with a population of 50,000 or more.",1
"Technological advancements in highway engineering have improved the design, construction, and maintenance methods used over the years.",1

"Subsurface utility engineering refers to a branch of engineering that involves managing certain risks associated with utility mapping at appropriate quality levels, utility coordination, utility relocation design and coordination, utility condition assessment, communication of utility data to concerned parties, utility relocation cost estimates, implementation of utility accommodation policies, and utility design.The SUE process begins with a work plan that outlines the scope of work, project schedule, levels of service vs. risk allocation and desired delivery method.",1
"Hydraulic engineering as a sub-discipline of civil engineering is concerned with the flow and conveyance of fluids, principally water and sewage.",1
"Hydraulic engineering is the application of the principles of fluid mechanics to problems dealing with the collection, storage, control, transport, regulation, measurement, and use of water.",1
"Before beginning a hydraulic engineering project, one must figure out how much water is involved.",1
Hydraulic engineering was highly developed in Europe under the aegis of the Roman Empire where it was especially applied to the construction and maintenance of aqueducts to supply water to and remove sewage from their cities.,1
"Through hydraulic engineering, it also constructed many of the limestone wells and cisterns of the state that are still operative and in use today.",1
"Hydraulic Engineering in the 21st Century : Where to ?, Journal of Hydraulic Research, IAHR, Vol.",1
A dam is a barrier that stops or restricts the flow of water or underground streams.,1
"Reservoirs created by dams not only suppress floods but also provide water for activities such as irrigation, human consumption, industrial use, aquaculture, and navigability.",1
A dam can also be used to collect water or for storage of water which can be evenly distributed between locations.,1
"Dams generally serve the primary purpose of retaining water, while other structures such as floodgates or levees are used to manage or prevent water flow into specific land regions.",1
"The earliest known dam is the Jawa Dam in Jordan, dating to 3,000 BC.",1
"The word dam can be traced back to Middle English, and before that, from Middle Dutch, as seen in the names of many old cities.",1
The first known appearance of dam occurs in 1165.,1
"However, there is one village, Obdam, that is already mentioned in 1120.",1
"Dams were used to control the water level, for Mesopotamia's weather affected the Tigris and Euphrates rivers.",1
"The earliest known dam is the Jawa Dam in Jordan, 100 kilometres northeast of the capital Amman.",1
"This gravity dam featured an originally 9-metre-high and 1 m-wide stone wall, supported by a 50 m-wide earth rampart.",1
Two dams called Ha-Uar running east–west were built to retain water during the annual flood and then release it to surrounding lands.,1
"The system included 16 reservoirs, dams and various channels for collecting water and storing it.One of the engineering wonders of the ancient world was the Great Dam of Marib in Yemen.",1
"Eflatun Pınar is a Hittite dam and spring temple near Konya, Turkey.",1
The purpose of the dam was to divert the waters of the Kaveri across the fertile delta region for irrigation via canals.Du Jiang Yan is the oldest surviving irrigation system in China that included a dam that directed waterflow.,1
"A large earthen dam, made by Sunshu Ao, the prime minister of Chu, flooded a valley in modern-day northern Anhui province that created an enormous irrigation reservoir in circumference), a reservoir that is still present today.",1
The highest Roman dam was the Subiaco Dam near Rome; its record height of 50 m remained unsurpassed until its accidental destruction in 1305.Roman engineers made routine use of ancient standard designs like embankment dams and masonry gravity dams.,1
"These include arch-gravity dams, arch dams, buttress dams and multiple arch buttress dams, all of which were known and employed by the 2nd century AD.",1
"In Iran, bridge dams such as the Band-e Kaisar were used to provide hydropower through water wheels, which often powered water-raising mechanisms.",1
Milling dams were introduced which the Muslim engineers called the Pul-i-Bulaiti.,1
"Another one, the Band-i-Amir dam, provided irrigation for 300 villages.",1
"Such dams often marked the beginning of a town or city because it was easy to cross the river at such a place, and often gave rise to the respective place's names in Dutch.",1
"For instance the Dutch capital Amsterdam started with a dam through the river Amstel in the late 12th century, and Rotterdam started with a dam through the river Rotte, a minor tributary of the Nieuwe Maas.",1
"The central square of Amsterdam, covering the original place of the 800-year-old dam, still carries the name Dam Square or simply the Dam.",1
Three pioneering arch dams were built around the British Empire in the early 19th century.,1
"In particular, the Jones Falls Dam, built by John Redpath, was completed in 1832 as the largest dam in North America and an engineering marvel.",1
The masonry arch dam wall was designed by Lieutenant Percy Simpson who was influenced by the advances in dam engineering techniques made by the Royal Engineers in India.,1
"The dam cost £17,000 and was completed in 1856 as the first engineered dam built in Australia, and the second arch dam in the world built to mathematical specifications.The first such dam was opened two years earlier in France.",1
"The 75-miles dam near Warwick, Australia, was possibly the world's first concrete arch dam.",1
This transformed dam design from an art based on empirical methodology to a profession based on a rigorously applied scientific theoretical framework.,1
"Man-made dams are typically classified according to their size, intended purpose or structure.",1
"For this type of dam, firm reliable supports at the abutments are more important.",1
"The safety of an arch dam is dependent on the strength of the side wall abutments, hence not only should the arch be well seated on the side walls but also the character of the rock should be carefully inspected.",1
"Two types of single-arch dams are in use, namely the constant-angle and the constant-radius dam.",1
"Jones Falls Dam, in Canada, is a constant radius dam.",1
"In a constant-angle dam, also known as a variable radius dam, this subtended angle is kept a constant and the variation in distance between the abutments at various levels are taken care of by varying the radii.",1
Constant-radius dams are much less common than constant-angle dams.,1
Parker Dam on the Colorado River is a constant-angle arch dam.,1
"Wildhorse Dam near Mountain City, Nevada, in the United States is an example of the type.",1
"The multiple-arch dam consists of a number of single-arch dams with concrete buttresses as the supporting abutments, as for example the Daniel-Johnson Dam, Québec, Canada.",1
"The multiple-arch dam does not require as many buttresses as the hollow gravity type, but requires good rock foundation because the buttress loads are heavy.",1
"The dam's weight counteracts that force, tending to rotate the dam the other way about its toe.",1
The designer ensures that the dam is heavy enough that the dam's weight wins that contest.,1
"For this type of dam, it is essential to have an impervious foundation with high bearing strength.",1
"Gravity dams are classified as ""solid"" or ""hollow"" and are generally made of either concrete or masonry.",1
Grand Coulee Dam is a solid gravity dam and Braddock Locks & Dam is a hollow gravity dam.,1
The inward compression of the dam by the water reduces the lateral force acting on the dam.,1
the dam does not need to be so massive.,1
This enables thinner dams and saves resources.,1
"Embankment dams rely on their weight to hold back the force of water, like gravity dams made from concrete.",1
Rock-fill dams are resistant to damage from earthquakes.,1
An example of a rock-fill dam is New Melones Dam in California or the Fierza Dam in Albania.,1
The majority of such dams are built with rock and/or gravel as the main fill material.,1
Almost 100 dams of this design have now been built worldwide since the first such dam was completed in 1962.,1
All asphalt-concrete core dams built so far have an excellent performance record.,1
A homogeneous rolled-earth dam is entirely constructed of one type of material but may contain a drain layer to collect seep water.,1
"A zoned-earth dam has distinct parts or zones of dissimilar material, typically a locally plentiful shell with a watertight clay core.",1
Rolled-earth dams may also employ a watertight facing or core in the manner of a rock-fill dam.,1
Tarbela Dam is a large dam on the Indus River in Pakistan.,1
"Because earthen dams can be constructed from materials found on-site or nearby, they can be very cost-effective in regions where the cost of producing or bringing in concrete would be prohibitive.",1
Fixed-crest dams are designed to maintain depth in the channel for navigation.,1
"Dam size influences construction, repair, and removal costs and affects the dams’ potential range and magnitude of environmental disturbances.",1
International standards define large dams as higher than 15 m and major dams as over 150 m in height.,1
"In addition, hydropower dams can be classified as either high-head or low-head.The tallest dam in the world is the 305 m-high Jinping-I Dam in China.",1
"Small dams can be particularly useful on farms to capture runoff for later use, for example, during the dry season.",1
"Small scale dams have the potential to generate benefits without displacing people as well, and small, decentralised hydroelectric dams can aid rural development in developing countries.",1
"Records of small dams are kept by state regulatory agencies and therefore information about small dams is dispersed and uneven in geographic coverage.Countries worldwide consider small hydropower plants important for their energy strategies, and there has been a notable increase in interest in SHPs.",1
"Most of the United States' dams, 2.41 million out of a total of 2.5 million dams, are not under the jurisdiction of any public agency, nor are they listed on the National Inventory of Dams.",1
"Graham’s 1999 study of US dam failures resulting in fatalities from 1960-1998 concluded that the failure of dams between 6.1 and 15 m high caused 86% of the deaths, and the failure of dams less than 6.1 m high caused 2% of the deaths.",1
"Non-jurisdictional dams may pose hazards because their design, construction, maintenance, and surveillance is not regulated.",1
"An auxiliary dam is constructed in a low spot or ""saddle"" through which the reservoir would otherwise escape.",1
"Conversely, a wing dam is a structure that only partly restricts a waterway, creating a faster channel that resists the accumulation of sediment.",1
"Underground dams are typically constructed in areas where water resources are minimal and need to be efficiently stored, such as in deserts and on islands like the Fukuzato Dam in Okinawa, Japan.",1
A sub-surface dam is built across an aquifer or drainage route from an impervious layer up to just below the surface.,1
A sand-storage dam is a weir built in stages across a stream or wadi.,1
"Conventional water retention dams can serve this purpose, but due to cost, a tailings dam is more viable.",1
"Unlike water retention dams, a tailings dam is raised in succession throughout the life of the particular mine.",1
"Typically, a base or starter dam is constructed, and as it fills with a mixture of tailings and water, it is raised.",1
"Material used to raise the dam can include the tailings along with dirt.There are three raised tailings dam designs, the upstream, downstream and centerline, named according to the movement of the crest during raising.",1
"An upstream tailings dam consists of trapezoidal embankments being constructed on top but toe to crest of another, moving the crest further upstream.",1
"A centerlined dam has sequential embankment dams constructed directly on top of another while fill is placed on the downstream side for support and slurry supports the upstream side.Because tailings dams often store toxic chemicals from the mining process, they have an impervious liner to prevent seepage.",1
"Intended as permanent structures, steel dams were an experiment to determine if a construction technique could be devised that was cheaper than masonry, concrete or earthworks, but sturdier than timber crib dams.",1
"The locations where timber dams are most economical to build are those where timber is plentiful, cement is costly or difficult to transport, and either a low head diversion dam is required or longevity is not an issue.",1
"Timber dams were once numerous, especially in the North American West, but most have failed, been hidden under earth embankments, or been replaced with entirely new structures.",1
Two common variations of timber dams were the crib and the plank.,1
Timber crib dams were erected of heavy timbers or dressed logs in the manner of a log house and the interior filled with earth or rubble.,1
Splash dams were timber crib dams used to help float logs downstream in the late 19th and early 20th centuries.,1
Timber plank dams were more elegant structures that employed a variety of construction methods utilizing heavy timbers to support a water retaining arrangement of planks.,1
Common uses for cofferdams include construction and repair of offshore oil platforms.,1
In such cases the cofferdam is fabricated from sheet steel and welded into place under water.,1
"Lava dams are formed when lava flows, often basaltic, intercept the path of a stream or lake outlet, resulting in the creation of a natural impoundment.",1
"Historical examples include the Usoi Dam in Tajikistan, which blocks the Murghab River to create Sarez Lake.",1
Natural dams often pose significant hazards to human settlements and infrastructure.,1
Many dams in areas where precipitation fluctuates in an annual cycle will also see the reservoir fluctuate annually in an attempt to balance these difference purposes.,1
Dam management becomes a complex exercise amongst competing stakeholders.,1
The primary function of the dam's structure is to fill the gap in the natural reservoir line left by the stream channel.,1
"Older dams often lack a fish ladder, which keeps many fish from moving upstream to their natural breeding grounds, causing failure of breeding cycles or blocking of migration paths.",1
"Large reservoirs formed behind dams have been indicated in the contribution of seismic activity, due to changes in water load and/or the height of the water table.Dams are also found to have a role in the increase/decrease of global warming.",1
"While dams and the water behind them cover only a small portion of earth's surface, they harbour biological activity that can produce large amounts of greenhouse gases.",1
Most dams incorporate mechanisms to permit the reservoir to be lowered or even drained in the event of such problems.,1
"During an armed conflict, a dam is to be considered as an ""installation containing dangerous forces"" due to the massive impact of a possible destruction on the civilian population and the environment.",1
"The main causes of dam failure include inadequate spillway capacity, piping through the embankment, foundation or abutments, spillway design error, geological instability caused by changes to water levels during filling or poor surveying, poor maintenance, especially of outlet pipes, extreme rainfall, earthquakes, and human, computer or design error.",1
"A notable case of deliberate dam failure was the Royal Air Force 'Dambusters' raid on Germany in World War II, in which three German dams were selected to be breached in order to damage German infrastructure and manufacturing and power capabilities deriving from the Ruhr and Eder rivers.",1

"River engineering is the process of planned human intervention in the course, characteristics, or flow of a river with the intention of producing some defined benefit.",1
"From the late 20th century, river engineering has had environmental concerns broader than immediate human benefit and some river engineering projects have been concerned exclusively with the restoration or protection of natural characteristics and habitats.",1
River engineering has often resulted in unintended systematic responses.,1
The river engineering discipline now strives to repair hydromodified degradations and account for potential systematic response to planned alterations by considering fluvial geomorphology.,1
"River engineering attempts to understand fluvial geomorphology, implement a physical alteration, and maintain public safety.",1
"River engineering works are only required to prevent changes in the course of the stream, to regulate its depth, and especially to fix the low-water channel and concentrate the flow in it, so as to increase as far as practicable the navigable depth at the lowest stage of the water level.",1
"Coastal engineering is a branch of civil engineering concerned with the specific demands posed by constructing at or near the coast, as well as the development of the coast itself.",1
"The areas of interest in coastal engineering include the coasts of the oceans, seas, marginal seas, estuaries and big lakes.",1
"Most often, in coastal engineering projects there is a need for metocean conditions: local wind and wave climate, as well as statistics for and information on other hydrodynamic quantities of interest.",1
The practices in present-day coastal engineering are more-and-more based on models verified and validated by experimental data.,1
"Groundwater engineering, another name for hydrogeology, is a branch of engineering which is concerned with groundwater movement and design of wells, pumps, and drains.",1

Electricity is the set of physical phenomena associated with the presence and motion of matter that has a property of electric charge.,1
"In the early days, electricity was considered as being unrelated to magnetism.",1
"Electricity is at the heart of many modern technologies, being used for:

electric power where electric current is used to energise equipment;
electronics which deals with electrical circuits that involve active electrical components such as vacuum tubes, transistors, diodes and integrated circuits, and associated passive interconnection technologies.Electrical phenomena have been studied since antiquity, though progress in theoretical understanding remained slow until the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries.",1
"Even then, practical applications for electricity were few, and it would not be until the late nineteenth century that electrical engineers were able to put it to industrial and residential use.",1
"Electricity's extraordinary versatility means it can be put to an almost limitless set of applications which include transport, heating, lighting, communications, and computation.",1
"Electricity would remain little more than an intellectual curiosity for millennia until 1600, when the English scientist William Gilbert wrote De Magnete, in which he made a careful study of electricity and magnetism, distinguishing the lodestone effect from static electricity produced by rubbing amber.",1
"Electricity and magnetism were definitively linked by James Clerk Maxwell, in particular in his ""On Physical Lines of Force"" in 1861 and 1862.While the early 19th century had seen rapid progress in electrical science, the late 19th century would see the greatest progress in electrical engineering.",1
"The informal term static electricity refers to the net presence of charge on a body, usually caused when dissimilar materials are rubbed together, transferring charge from one to the other.",1
Electricity is usually sold by the kilowatt hour which is the product of power in kilowatts multiplied by running time in hours.,1
"Electric utilities measure power using electricity meters, which keep a running total of the electric energy delivered to a customer.",1
"Unlike fossil fuels, electricity is a low entropy form of energy and can be converted into motion or many other forms of energy with high efficiency.",1
"This requires electricity utilities to make careful predictions of their electrical loads, and maintain constant co-ordination with their power stations.",1
Demand for electricity grows with great rapidity as a nation modernises and its economy develops.,1
"Historically, the growth rate for electricity demand has outstripped that for other forms of energy.Environmental concerns with electricity generation have led to an increased focus on generation from renewable sources, in particular from wind and solar.",1
"Electricity is however still a highly practical energy source for heating and refrigeration, with air conditioning/heat pumps representing a growing sector for electricity demand for heating and cooling, the effects of which electricity utilities are increasingly obliged to accommodate.Electricity is used within telecommunications, and indeed the electrical telegraph, demonstrated commercially in 1837 by Cooke and Wheatstone, was one of its earliest applications.",1
"This phenomenon is known as piezoelectricity, from the Greek piezein, meaning to press, and was discovered in 1880 by Pierre and Jacques Curie.",1
The revitalization of monsters with electricity later became a stock theme in horror films.,1
"As the public familiarity with electricity as the lifeblood of the Second Industrial Revolution grew, its wielders were more often cast in a positive light, such as the workers who ""finger death at their gloves' end as they piece and repiece the living wires"" in Rudyard Kipling's 1907 poem Sons of Martha.",1
"The masters of electricity, whether fictional or real—including scientists such as Thomas Edison, Charles Steinmetz or Nikola Tesla—were popularly conceived of as having wizard-like powers.With electricity ceasing to be a novelty and becoming a necessity of everyday life in the later half of the 20th century, it required particular attention by popular culture only when it stops flowing, an event that usually signals disaster.",1

The process of developing a mathematical model is termed mathematical modeling.,1
"Mathematical models are used in the natural sciences and engineering disciplines, as well as in the social sciences.",1
"In general, mathematical models may include logical models.",1
Lack of agreement between theoretical mathematical models and experimental measurements often leads to important advances as better theories are developed.,1
Complicated mathematical models that have many variables may be consolidated by use of vectors where one symbol represents several variables.,1
Different mathematical models use different geometries that are not necessarily accurate descriptions of the geometry of the universe.,1

"Ptolemy, in his treatise Optics, held an extramission-intromission theory of vision: the rays from the eye formed a cone, the vertex being within the eye, and the base defining the visual field.",1
Wave optics was successfully unified with electromagnetic theory by James Clerk Maxwell in the 1860s.The next development in optical theory came in 1899 when Max Planck correctly modelled blackbody radiation by assuming that the exchange of energy between light and matter only occurred in discrete amounts he called quanta.,1
"Quantum optics gained practical importance with the inventions of the maser in 1953 and of the laser in 1960.Following the work of Paul Dirac in quantum field theory, George Sudarshan, Roy J.

A laser is a device that emits light through a process of optical amplification based on the stimulated emission of electromagnetic radiation.,1
"The term ""laser"" originated as an acronym for ""light amplification by stimulated emission of radiation"".",1
"The first laser was built in 1960 by Theodore H. Maiman at Hughes Research Laboratories, based on theoretical work by Charles Hard Townes and Arthur Leonard Schawlow.",1
A laser differs from other sources of light in that it emits light which is coherent.,1
"Spatial coherence allows a laser to be focused to a tight spot, enabling applications such as laser cutting and lithography.",1
"Spatial coherence also allows a laser beam to stay narrow over great distances, enabling applications such as laser pointers and lidar.",1
"Lasers can also have high temporal coherence, which allows them to emit light with a very narrow spectrum, i.e., they can emit a single color of light.",1
"Lasers are used in optical disk drives, laser printers, barcode scanners, DNA sequencing instruments, fiber-optic, semiconducting chip manufacturing, and free-space optical communication, laser surgery and skin treatments, cutting and welding materials, military and law enforcement devices for marking targets and measuring range and speed, and in laser lighting displays for entertainment.",1
"Laser beams can be focused to very tiny spots, achieving a very high irradiance, or they can have very low divergence in order to concentrate their power at a great distance.",1
Lasers are characterized according to their wavelength in a vacuum.,1
"Most ""single wavelength"" lasers actually produce radiation in several modes with slightly different wavelengths.",1
Some lasers are not single spatial mode and have light beams that diverge more than is required by the diffraction limit.,1
Lasers are employed where light of the required spatial or temporal coherence can not be produced using simpler technologies.,1
"Further use of the words laser and maser in an extended sense, not referring to laser technology or devices, can be seen in usages such as astrophysical maser and atom laser.",1
The most common type of laser uses feedback from an optical cavity—a pair of mirrors on either end of the gain medium.,1
"Most practical lasers contain additional elements that affect properties of the emitted light, such as the polarization, wavelength, and shape of the beam.",1
"In most lasers this medium consists of a population of atoms which have been excited into such a state by means of an outside light source, or an electrical field which supplies energy for atoms to absorb and be transformed into their excited states.",1
"The gain medium of a laser is normally a material of controlled purity, size, concentration, and shape, which amplifies the beam by the process of stimulated emission described above.",1
"In a continuous wave laser, the balance of pump power against gain saturation and cavity losses produces an equilibrium value of the laser power inside the cavity; this equilibrium determines the operating point of the laser.",1
Some lasers use a separate injection seeder to start the process off with a beam that is already highly coherent.,1
Many lasers produce a beam that can be approximated as a Gaussian beam; such beams have the minimum divergence possible for a given beam diameter.,1
"Some lasers, particularly high-power ones, produce multimode beams, with the transverse modes often approximated using Hermite–Gaussian or Laguerre-Gaussian functions.",1
"Some high power lasers use a flat-topped profile known as a ""tophat beam"".",1
Unstable laser resonators produce fractal-shaped beams.,1
"Near the ""waist"" of a laser beam, it is highly collimated: the wavefronts are planar, normal to the direction of propagation, with no beam divergence at that point.",1
"This unique property of laser light, spatial coherence, cannot be replicated using standard light sources as can be appreciated by comparing the beam from a flashlight or spotlight to that of almost any laser.",1
"A laser beam profiler is used to measure the intensity profile, width, and divergence of laser beams.",1
Diffuse reflection of a laser beam from a matte surface produces a speckle pattern with interesting properties.,1
Of course even a laser whose output is normally continuous can be intentionally turned on and off at some rate in order to create pulses of light.,1
Most laser diodes used in communication systems fall in that category.,1
Such a laser is known as continuous wave.,1
Many types of lasers can be made to operate in continuous wave mode to satisfy such an application.,1
"Many of these lasers actually lase in several longitudinal modes at the same time, and beats between the slightly different optical frequencies of those oscillations will, in fact, produce amplitude variations on time scales shorter than the round-trip time, typically a few nanoseconds or less.",1
"In most cases, these lasers are still termed ""continuous wave"" as their output power is steady when averaged over any longer time periods, with the very high-frequency power variations having little or no impact in the intended application.",1
"In some other lasers, it would require pumping the laser at a very high continuous power level which would be impractical or destroy the laser by producing excessive heat.",1
Such lasers cannot be run in CW mode.,1
Some lasers are pulsed simply because they cannot be run in continuous mode.,1
"In laser ablation, for example, a small volume of material at the surface of a work piece can be evaporated if it is heated in a very short time, while supplying the energy gradually would allow for the heat to be absorbed into the bulk of the piece, never attaining a sufficiently high temperature at a particular point.",1
"Such mode-locked lasers are a most versatile tool for researching processes occurring on extremely short time scales, for maximizing the effect of nonlinearity in optical materials (e.g.",1
"These lasers, such as the excimer laser and the copper vapor laser, can never be operated in CW mode.",1
Maiman's functional laser used a flashlamp-pumped synthetic ruby crystal to produce red laser light at 694 nanometers wavelength.,1
"This first semiconductor laser could only be used in pulsed-beam operation, and when cooled to liquid nitrogen temperatures.",1
"Since the laser operates in the superconducting regime, it is more stable than other semiconductor-based lasers.",1
Gas lasers using many different gases have been built and used for many purposes.,1

Commercial carbon dioxide lasers can emit many hundreds of watts in a single spatial mode which can be concentrated into a tiny spot.,1
The efficiency of a CO2 laser is unusually high: over 30%.,1
Argon-ion lasers can operate at a number of lasing transitions between 351 and 528.7 nm.,1
Metal ion lasers are gas lasers that generate deep ultraviolet wavelengths.,1
"Like all low-pressure gas lasers, the gain media of these lasers have quite narrow oscillation linewidths, less than 3 GHz, making them candidates for use in fluorescence suppressed Raman spectroscopy.",1
"Such very high power lasers are especially of interest to the military, however continuous wave chemical lasers at very high power levels, fed by streams of gasses, have been developed and have some industrial applications.",1
Excimer lasers typically operate at ultraviolet wavelengths with major applications including semiconductor photolithography and LASIK eye surgery.,1
"The molecular fluorine laser, emitting at 157 nm in the vacuum ultraviolet is sometimes referred to as an excimer laser, however this appears to be a misnomer inasmuch as F2 is a stable compound.",1
"For example, the first working laser was a ruby laser, made from ruby.",1
Semiconductor lasers are typically not referred to as solid-state lasers.,1
All these lasers can produce high powers in the infrared spectrum at 1064 nm.,1
"These lasers are also commonly frequency doubled, tripled or quadrupled to produce 532 nm, 355 nm and 266 nm beams, respectively.",1
Frequency-doubled diode-pumped solid-state lasers are used to make bright green laser pointers.,1
Thermal limitations in solid-state lasers arise from unconverted pump power that heats the medium.,1
Diode-pumped thin disk lasers overcome these issues by having a gain medium that is much thinner than the diameter of the pump beam.,1
Thin disk lasers have been shown to produce beams of up to one kilowatt.,1
"Quite often, the fiber laser is designed as a double-clad fiber.",1
Fiber lasers have a fundamental limit in that the intensity of the light in the fiber cannot be so high that optical nonlinearities induced by the local electric field strength can become dominant and prevent laser operation and/or lead to the material destruction of the fiber.,1
"In bulk laser materials, the cooling is not so efficient, and it is difficult to separate the effects of photodarkening from the thermal effects, but the experiments in fibers show that the photodarkening can be attributed to the formation of long-living color centers.",1
Commercial laser diodes emit at wavelengths from 375 nm to 3500 nm.,1
"Low to medium power laser diodes are used in laser pointers, laser printers and CD/DVD players.",1
Laser diodes are also frequently used to optically pump other lasers with high efficiency.,1
"The highest power industrial laser diodes, with power up to 20 kW, are used in industry for cutting and welding.",1

Quantum cascade lasers are semiconductor lasers that have an active transition between energy sub-bands of an electron in a structure containing several quantum wells.,1
The development of a silicon laser is important in the field of optical computing.,1
These are called hybrid silicon laser.,1

"Another type is a Raman laser, which takes advantage of Raman scattering to produce a laser from materials such as silicon.",1
"Although these tunable lasers are mainly known in their liquid form, researchers have also demonstrated narrow-linewidth tunable emission in dispersive oscillator configurations incorporating solid-state dye gain media.",1
"Unlike gas, liquid, or solid-state lasers, which rely on bound atomic or molecular states, FELs use a relativistic electron beam as the lasing medium, hence the term free-electron.",1
"Fiber-optic communication using lasers is a key technology in modern communications, allowing services such as the Internet.",1

"Hip replacement is a surgical procedure in which the hip joint is replaced by a prosthetic implant, that is, a hip prosthesis.",1
Hip replacement surgery can be performed as a total replacement or a hemi replacement.,1
A total hip replacement consists of replacing both the acetabulum and the femoral head while hemiarthroplasty generally only replaces the femoral head.,1
"Hip replacement is currently one of the most common orthopaedic operations, though patient satisfaction short- and long-term varies widely.",1
Approximately 58% of total hip replacements are estimated to last 25 years.,1
"Hip replacement is usually considered only after other therapies, such as physical therapy and pain medications, have recently failed.",1
Weight loss surgery before a hip replacement does not appear to change outcomes.,1
"The analysis of 402,051 hip replacements showed that 6.2% of metal-on-metal hip implants had failed within five years, compared to 1.7% of metal-on-plastic and 2.3% of ceramic-on-ceramic hip implants.",1

"Biomaterials science encompasses elements of medicine, biology, chemistry, tissue engineering and materials science.",1
"Note that a biomaterial is different from a biological material, such as bone, that is produced by a biological system.",1
A biomaterial that is biocompatible or suitable for one application may not be biocompatible in another.,1
"Biomaterials are also used every day in dental applications, surgery, and drug delivery.",1
"A biomaterial may also be an autograft, allograft or xenograft used as a transplant material.",1
Thus for many biomaterials good biocompatibility along with good strength and dissolution rates are desirable.,1
"Commonly, bioactivity of biomaterials is gauged by the surface biomineralisation in which a native layer of hydroxyapatite is formed at the surface.",1
"Because of this, biomaterials are usually subjected to the same requirements as those undergone by new drug therapies.All manufacturing companies are also required to ensure traceability of all of their products so that if a defective product is discovered, others in the same batch may be traced.",1
Immuno-informed biomaterials that direct the immune response rather than attempting to circumvent the process is one approach that shows promise.,1
A surgical implantation of a biomaterial into the body triggers an organism-inflammatory reaction with the associated healing of the damaged tissue.,1

"Back-end or deferred speech recognition is where the provider dictates into a digital dictation system, the voice is routed through a speech-recognition machine and the recognized draft document is routed along with the original voice file to the editor, where the draft is edited and report finalized.",1
Deferred speech recognition is widely used in the industry currently.,1
"The use of speech recognition is more naturally suited to the generation of narrative text, as part of a radiology/pathology interpretation, progress note or discharge summary: the ergonomic gains of using speech recognition to enter structured discrete data are relatively minimal for people who are sighted and who can operate a keyboard and mouse.",1

"A distribution board is a component of an electricity supply system that divides an electrical power feed into subsidiary circuits, while providing a protective fuse or circuit breaker for each circuit in a common enclosure.",1
"In the United Kingdom, a distribution board designed for domestic installations is known as a consumer unit.",1
"During servicing of the distribution board, when the cover has been removed and the cables are visible, American panelboards commonly have some live parts exposed.",1
The main distribution board in an installation will also normally provide a main switch which switches the phase and neutral lines for the whole supply.,1
"New British distribution boards generally have the live parts enclosed to IP2X, even when the cover has been removed for servicing.",1
"Distribution boards may be designated for three phase or single phase and normal power or emergency power, or designated by use such as  distribution panels for supplying other panels, lighting panels for lights, power panels for equipment and receptacles and special uses.",1
Distribution boards may be surface-mounted or flush.,1
"Lightning is a naturally occurring electrostatic discharge during which two electrically charged regions in the atmosphere or ground temporarily equalize themselves, causing the instantaneous release of as much as one gigajoule of energy.",1
"Lightning causes thunder, a sound from the shock wave which develops as gases in the vicinity of the discharge experience a sudden increase in pressure.",1
"Lightning occurs commonly during thunderstorms and other types of energetic weather systems, but volcanic lightning can also occur during volcanic eruptions.",1
"The three main kinds of lightning are distinguished by where they occur: either inside a single thundercloud, between two different clouds, or between a cloud and the ground.",1
"Humans have deified lightning for millennia, and lightning-inspired expressions like ""bolt from the blue"", ""to be struck by lightning"", ""lightning never strikes twice"" and ""blitzkrieg"" are in common usage.",1
"Lightning primarily occurs when warm air is mixed with colder air masses, resulting in atmospheric disturbances necessary for polarizing the atmosphere.",1
"Hurricanes typically generate some lightning, mainly in the rainbands as much as 160 km from the center.The science of lightning is called fulminology, and the fear of lightning is called astraphobia.",1
"On Earth, the lightning frequency is approximately 44 times per second, or nearly 1.4 billion flashes per year and the average duration is 0.2 seconds made up from a number of much shorter flashes of around 60 to 70 microseconds.Many factors affect the frequency, distribution, strength and physical properties of a typical lightning flash in a particular region of the world.",1
"Lightning's relative unpredictability limits a complete explanation of how or why it occurs, even after hundreds of years of scientific investigation.",1
About 70% of lightning occurs over land in the tropics where atmospheric convection is the greatest.,1
"The place on Earth where lightning occurs most often is near the small village of Kifuka in the mountains of the eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo, where the elevation is around 975 m.",1
Other lightning hotspots Singapore and Lightning Alley in Central Florida.,1
Initiation of the lightning leaders is not well understood.,1
"Most CG lightning is negative, meaning that a negative charge is transferred to ground and electrons travel downward along the lightning channel.",1
"Positive lightning is less common than negative lightning, and on average makes up less than 5% of all lightning strikes.",1
Positive lightning strikes tend to be much more intense than their negative counterparts.,1
"An average bolt of negative lightning carries an electric current of 30,000 amperes, and transfers 15 coulombs of electric charge and 1 gigajoule of energy.",1
"Large bolts of negative lightning can carry up to 120 kA and 350 C. The average positive ground flash has roughly double the peak current of a typical negative flash, and can produce peak currents up to 400 kA and charges of several hundred coulombs.",1
Positive lightning has also been shown to trigger the occurrence of upward lightning flashes from the tops of tall structures and is largely responsible for the initiation of sprites several tens of kilometers above ground level.,1
"Positive lightning tends to occur more frequently in winter storms, as with thundersnow, during intense tornadoes and in the dissipation stage of a thunderstorm.",1
Intra-cloud lightning is the most frequently occurring type.Intra-cloud lightning most commonly occurs between the upper anvil portion and lower reaches of a given thunderstorm.,1
"This lightning can sometimes be observed at great distances at night as so-called ""sheet lightning"".",1
"Ball lightning may be an atmospheric electrical phenomenon, the physical nature of which is still controversial.",1
Ball lightning has been described by eyewitnesses but rarely recorded by meteorologists.,1
Scientific data on natural ball lightning is scarce owing to its infrequency and unpredictability.,1
"Bead lightning, also known by the terms pearl lightning, chain lightning, perlschnurblitz and eclair en chapelet, to name a few  is the decaying stage of a lightning channel in which the luminosity of the channel breaks up into segments.",1
"Nearly every lightning discharge will exhibit beading as the channel cools immediately after a return stroke, sometimes referred to as the lightning's 'bead-out' stage.",1
'Bead lightning' is more properly a stage of a normal lightning discharge rather than a type of lightning in itself.,1
"Beading of a lightning channel is usually a small-scale feature, and therefore is often only apparent when the observer/camera is close to the lightning.",1
"Cloud-to-air lightning is a lightning flash in which one end of a bidirectional leader exits the cloud, but does not result in a ground flash.",1
"Dry lightning is used in Australia, Canada and the United States for lightning that occurs with no precipitation at the surface.",1
This type of lightning is the most common natural cause of wildfires.,1
Pyrocumulus clouds produce lightning for the same reason that it is produced by cumulonimbus clouds.,1
Forked lightning is cloud-to-ground lightning that exhibits branching of its path.,1
Heat lightning is a lightning flash that appears to produce no discernible thunder because it occurs too far away for the thunder to be heard.,1
Ribbon lightning occurs in thunderstorms with high cross winds and multiple return strokes.,1
"Rocket lightning is a form of cloud discharge, generally horizontal and at cloud base, with a luminous channel appearing to advance through the air with visually resolvable speed, often intermittently.",1
"Sheet lightning is cloud-to-cloud lightning that exhibits a diffuse brightening of the surface of a cloud, caused by the actual discharge path being hidden or too far away.",1
"The lightning itself cannot be seen by the spectator, so it appears as only a flash, or a sheet of light.",1
The lightning may be too far away to discern individual flashes.,1
Smooth channel lightning is an informal term referring to a type of cloud-to-ground lightning strike that has no visible branching and appears like a line with smooth curves as opposed to the jagged appearance of most lightning channels.,1
"The term ""smooth channel lightning"" is also sometimes attributed to upward ground-to-cloud lightning flashes, which are generally negative flashes initiated by upward positive leaders from tall structures.",1
Staccato lightning is a cloud-to-ground lightning strike which is a short-duration stroke that appears as a single very bright flash and often has considerable branching.,1
Sympathetic lightning is the tendency of lightning to be loosely coordinated across long distances.,1
Upward lightning or ground-to-cloud lightning is a lightning flash which originates from the top of a grounded object and propagates upward from this point.,1
"This type of lightning can be triggered by a preceding lightning flash, or it may initiate entirely on its own.",1
Clear-air lightning describes lightning that occurs with no apparent cloud close enough to have produced it.,1
"The heat created by lightning currents traveling through a tree may vaporize its sap, causing a steam explosion that bursts the trunk.",1
"As lightning travels through sandy soil, the soil surrounding the plasma channel may melt, forming tubular structures called fulgurites.",1
"By safely conducting a lightning strike to ground, a lightning protection system can greatly reduce the probability of severe property damage.",1
Lightning also serves an important role in the nitrogen cycle by oxidizing diatomic nitrogen in the air into nitrates which are deposited by rain and can fertilize the growth of plants and other organisms.,1
A lightning flash preceding its thunder by one second would be approximately 343 m in distance; a delay of three seconds would indicate a distance of about 1 km or 0.62 mi.,1
"Consequently, a lightning strike observed at a very close distance will be accompanied by a sudden clap of thunder, with almost no perceptible time lapse, possibly accompanied by the smell of ozone.",1
Lightning at a sufficient distance may be seen and not heard; there is data that a lightning storm can be seen at over 160 km whereas the thunder travels about 32 km.,1
Each lightning flash in temperate and sub-tropical areas produces 7 kg of NOx on average.,1
Lightning on Venus has been a controversial subject after decades of study.,1
Lightning may be caused by the circulation of warm moisture-filled air through electric fields.,1
"Lightning discharges generate a wide range of electromagnetic radiations, including radio-frequency pulses.",1
Electromagnetic pulses transmitted by lightning strikes propagate within that waveguide.,1
"Such triggering of lightning is intended to protect rocket launching pads, electric power facilities, and other sensitive targets.",1
"Before the lightning strikes earth, the filaments lead electricity through the clouds, playing the role of lightning rods.",1
The intense currents of a lightning discharge create a fleeting but very strong magnetic field.,1
"Where the lightning current path passes through rock, soil, or metal these materials can become permanently magnetized.",1
"This effect is known as lightning-induced remanent magnetism, or LIRM.",1
"[Matthew 24:27][Luke 17:24]The expression ""Lightning never strikes twice"" is similar to ""Opportunity never knocks twice"" in the vein of a ""once in a lifetime"" opportunity, i.e., something that is generally considered improbable.",1
Lightning occurs frequently and more so in specific areas.,1
"Some political parties use lightning flashes as a symbol of power, such as the People's Action Party in Singapore, the British Union of Fascists during the 1930s, and the National States' Rights Party in the United States during the 1950s.",1
The lightning bolt is used to represent the instantaneous communication capabilities of electrically powered telegraphs and radios.,1

"Security is freedom from, or resilience against, potential harm caused by others.",1
"Beneficiaries of security may be of persons and social groups, objects and institutions, ecosystems or any other entity or phenomenon vulnerable to unwanted change.",1
"Security mostly refers to protection from hostile forces, but it has a wide range of other senses: for example, as the absence of harm (e.g.",1
food security); as resilience against potential damage or harm (e.g.,1
security forces; security guard; cyber security systems; security cameras; remote guarding).,1
"Security referents may be persons or social groups, objects, institutions, ecosystems, or any other phenomenon vulnerable to unwanted change by the forces of its environment.",1
"From this perspective, security and insecurity depend first on whether the environment is beneficial or hostile to the referent, and also how capable is the referent of responding to its/their environment in order to survive and thrive.",1
"Others argue that security depends principally on building the conditions in which equitable relationships can develop, partly by reducing antagonism between actors, ensuring that fundamental needs can be met, and also that differences of interest can be negotiated effectively.",1
The means of computer security include the physical security of systems and security of information held on them.,1
"The security of corporations has become more complex as reliance on IT systems has increased, and their physical presence has become more highly distributed across several countries, including environments that are, or may rapidly become, hostile to them.",1
The security of ecosystems has attracted greater attention as the impact of ecological damage by humans has grown.,1
Food security is gaining in importance as the world's population has grown and productive land has diminished through overuse and climate change.,1
"For example, two computer security programs installed on the same device can prevent each other from working properly, while the user assumes that he or she benefits from twice the protection that only one program would afford.",1

An escalator is a moving staircase which carries people between floors of a building.,1
"Escalators are often used around the world in places where lifts would be impractical, or they can be used in conjunction with them.",1
Escalators have the capacity to move large numbers of people.,1
"A nonfunctional escalator can function as a normal staircase, whereas many other methods of transport become useless when they break down or lose power.",1
Most modern escalators have single-piece aluminum or stainless steel steps that move on a system of tracks in a continuous loop.,1
"Escalators are typically configured in one of three ways: parallel,  multiple parallel, or crisscross.Most countries require escalators to have moving handrails that keep pace with the movement of the steps as a safety measure.",1
"Some escalators need only to move people from one floor to another, but others may have specific requirements, such as funneling visitors towards exits or exhibits.",1
"For example, a single-width escalator traveling at about 0.5 metres per second can move about 2000 people per hour, assuming that passengers ride single file.",1
The carrying capacity of an escalator system is typically matched to the expected peak traffic demand.,1
"For example, escalators at transit stations must be designed to cater for the peak traffic flow discharged from a train, without excessive bunching at the escalator entrance.",1
"In this regard, escalators help manage the flow of people.",1
Escalators are often built next to or around staircases that allow alternative travel between the same two floors.,1
Some escalators have direction arrows on the ends of the balustrade.,1
Escalators' on/off buttons are frequently located at the ends of the balustrade.,1
"In most escalator models manufactured after 1950, both the riser and the tread of each step is cleated with comb-like protrusions that mesh with the comb plates on the top and bottom platforms and the succeeding steps in the chain.",1
Seeberger escalators featured flat treads and smooth risers; other escalator models have cleated treads and smooth risers.,1
"Fire protection of an escalator floor opening is also sometimes provided by adding automatic sprinklers or fireproof shutters to the opening, or by installing the escalator in an enclosed fire-protected space.",1
"In the escalators' undercarriage, approximately 8,800 kilograms of accumulated detritus acted as a wick to a neglected buildup of interior lubricants; wood veneers, paper and plastic advertisements, solvent-based paint, plywood in the ticket hall, and melamine combustion added to the impact of the calamity.Following the report, older wooden escalators were removed from service in the London Underground.",1
"Nonetheless, Foster-Miller Associates' 1980 plan, Escalator Modification for the Handicapped was ultimately ignored in favor of increased elevator installations in subway systems.",1

"An elevator or lift is a type of vertical transportation machine that moves people or freight between floors, levels, or decks of a building, vessel, or other structure.",1
"Elevators are typically powered by electric motors that drive traction cables and counterweight systems such as a hoist, although some pump hydraulic fluid to raise a cylindrical piston like a jack.",1
"In agriculture and manufacturing, an elevator is any type of conveyor device used to lift materials in a continuous stream into bins or silos.",1
"Because of wheelchair access laws, elevators are often a legal requirement in new multistory buildings, especially where wheelchair ramps would not be possible.",1
There are also some elevators which can go sideways in addition to the usual up-and-down motion.,1
"The first screw drive elevator was built by Ivan Kulibin and installed in the Winter Palace in 1793, although there may have been an earlier design by Leonardo da Vinci.",1
"The elevator was belt-driven and used a counterweight for extra power.The hydraulic crane was invented by Sir William Armstrong in 1846, primarily for use at the Tyneside docks for loading cargo.",1
The first elevator shaft preceded the first elevator by four years.,1
"An elevator shaft was included in the design, because Cooper was confident that a safe passenger elevator would soon be invented.",1
"Later, Otis designed a special elevator for the building.",1
"His elevator ran faster and with larger loads than hydraulic or steam elevators, and 584 electric elevators were installed before Sprague sold his company to the Otis Elevator Company in 1895.",1
"The first elevator in India was installed at the Raj Bhavan in Calcutta by Otis in 1892.By 1900, completely automated elevators were available, but passengers were reluctant to use them.",1
"A 1945 elevator operator strike in New York City, and adoption of an emergency stop button, emergency telephone, and a soothing explanatory automated voice aided adoption.In 2000, the first vacuum elevator was offered commercially in Argentina.",1
An elevator is essentially a platform that is either pulled or pushed up by a mechanical means.,1
"A modern-day elevator consists of a cab mounted on a platform within an enclosed space called a shaft or sometimes a ""hoistway"".",1
"In the past, elevator drive mechanisms were powered by steam and water hydraulic pistons or by hand.",1
"In a ""traction"" elevator, cars are pulled up by means of rolling steel ropes over a deeply grooved pulley, commonly called a sheave in the industry.",1
"Sometimes two elevators are built so that their cars always move synchronously in opposite directions, and are each other's counterweight.",1
Hydraulic elevators use the principles of hydraulics to pressurise an above ground or in-ground piston to raise and lower the car.,1
"Hydraulic elevators are cheaper, but installing cylinders greater than a certain length becomes impractical for very-high lift hoistways.",1
Hydraulic elevators are usually slower than traction elevators.,1
Elevators are a candidate for mass customisation.,1
"In less expensive installations the elevator can also use one large ""slab"" door: a single panel door the width of the doorway that opens to the left or right laterally.",1
"Some buildings have elevators with the single door on the shaftway, and double cascading doors on the cab.",1
"The world's first machine room-less elevator, the Kone MonoSpace was introduced in 1996, by Kone.",1
Residential MRL elevators are still not allowed by the ASME A17 code in the US.,1
MRL elevators have been recognised in the 2005 supplement to the 2004 A17.1 Elevator Code.,1
"Today, some machine room-less hydraulic elevators by Otis and ThyssenKrupp exist; they do not involve the use of a piston located underground or a machine room, mitigating environmental concerns; however, code is not yet accepting of them in all parts of the United States.",1
"Gearless traction elevators can reach speeds of up to 20 m/s, A brake is mounted between the motor and gearbox or between the motor and drive sheave or at the end of the drive sheave to hold the elevator stationary at a floor.",1
Elevators with more than 30 m of travel have a system called compensation.,1
"If the elevator cab is at the top of the hoist-way, there is a short length of hoist cable above the car and a long length of compensating cable below the car and vice versa for the counterweight.",1
"Holeless hydraulic elevators were developed in the 1970s, and use a pair of above ground cylinders, which makes it practical for environmentally or cost sensitive buildings with two, three, or four floors.",1
"Roped hydraulic elevators use both above ground cylinders and a rope system, allowing the elevator to travel further than the piston has to move.The low mechanical complexity of hydraulic elevators in comparison to traction elevators makes them ideal for low rise, low traffic installations.",1
"Climbing elevators are used in guyed masts or towers, in order to make easy access to parts of these constructions, such as flight safety lamps for maintenance.",1
"Temporary climbing elevators are commonly used in the construction of new high-rise buildings to move materials and personnel before the building's permanent elevator system is installed, at which point the climbing elevators are dismantled.",1
"Due to technical limitations, these elevators have a low capacity, they usually allow 1–3 passengers and up to 525 lbs.",1
Some of the older freight elevators were controlled by switches operated by pulling on adjacent ropes.,1
"In general, most elevators before WWII were manually controlled by elevator operators using a rheostat connected to the motor.",1
The elevator motor was located at the top of the shaft or beside the bottom of the shaft.,1
"Automatic elevators began to appear as early as the 1920s, their development being hastened by striking elevator operators which brought large cities dependent on skyscrapers such as New York and Chicago to their knees.",1
Self service elevators were not allowed in New York City until 1922.,1
"Relay-controlled elevator systems remained common until the 1980s and their gradual replacement with solid-state, microprocessor-based controls are now the industry standard.",1
"Most older, manually-operated elevators have been retrofitted with automatic or semi-automatic controls.",1
"In some elevators, certain floors are inaccessible unless one swipes a security card or enters a passcode.",1
"On many older elevators, if one is present, the door close button is functional because the elevator is not ADA compliant and/or it doesn't have a fire service mode.",1
Some elevators are configured to remain open at the floor until they are required to move again.,1
"Elevators in high traffic buildings often have a ""nudge"" function which will close the doors at a reduced speed, and sound a buzzer if the ""door open"" button is being deliberately held down, or if the door sensors have been blocked for too long a time.",1
Keeping an elevator stopped for too long may set off an alarm.,1
"No longer used on new elevators, where the sound is normally obligatory.",1
"If the particular elevator is currently serving traffic in a certain direction, it will only answer calls in the same direction unless there are no more calls beyond that floor.",1
Modern elevators use more complex heuristic algorithms to decide which request to service next.,1
"Inside the elevator there is no call button to push, or the buttons are there but they cannot be pushed — except door opening and alarm button — they only indicate stopping floors.",1
"Elevators are dispatched one-by-one when they reach a pre-determined passenger load, or when they have had their doors opened for a certain period of time.",1
"The next elevator to be dispatched usually has its hall lantern or a ""this car leaving next"" sign illuminated to encourage passengers to make maximum use of the available elevator system capacity.",1
Some elevator banks are programmed so that at least one car will always return to the lobby floor and park whenever it becomes free.,1
This allows the elevator system to provide maximum passenger handling capacity for people leaving the building.,1
"In this mode, an elevator will stop automatically at every floor, allowing people to step on and off without having to push any buttons.",1
"When an elevator is placed on this mode, it will no longer respond to hall calls.",1
"(In a bank of elevators, traffic is rerouted to the other elevators, while in a single elevator, the hall buttons are disabled).",1
The elevator will remain parked on a floor with its doors open until a floor is selected and the door close button is held until the elevator starts to travel.,1
"The elevator can now only be moved by the corresponding 'Access' key switches, usually located at the highest and lowest landings.",1
Elevators have a car top inspection station that allows the car to be operated by a mechanic in order to move it through the hoistway.,1
Most other elevators have an up/down toggle switch and a RUN button.,1
"The elevator will wait an amount of time, then proceed to go into nudging mode to tell everyone the elevator is leaving the floor.",1
"Once the elevator has left the floor, depending on where the alarm was set off, the elevator will go to the fire-recall floor.",1
"When the elevator is recalled, it proceeds to the recall floor and stops with its doors open.",1
The elevator will no longer respond to calls or move in any direction.,1
Once the elevator gets to the desired floor it will not open its doors unless the firefighter holds the door open button.,1
Passengers inside the elevator will be notified with an alarm and indicator light to exit the elevator when the doors open.,1
"Once the elevator arrives at the floor, it will park with its doors open and the car buttons will be disabled to prevent a passenger from taking control of the elevator.",1
"The elevator will then travel non-stop to the selected floor, and will remain in code-blue service until switched off in the car.",1
Some hospital elevators will feature a 'hold' position on the code-blue key switch which allows the elevator to remain at a floor locked out of service until code blue is deactivated.,1
People in the remaining elevators may see an indicator light or hear a voice announcement informing them that the elevator will return to the lobby shortly.,1
"As the elevator ages and equipment become increasingly difficult to find or replace, along with code changes and deteriorating ride performance, a complete overhaul of the elevator may be suggested to the building owners.",1
The cost of an elevator modernization can range greatly depending on which type of equipment is to be installed.,1
"Of the 20 to 30 elevator-related deaths each year, most of them are maintenance-related — for example, technicians leaning too far into the shaft or getting caught between moving parts, and most of the rest are attributed to other kinds of accidents, such as people stepping blindly through doors that open into empty shafts or being strangled by scarves caught in the doors.",1
"An elevator cab is typically borne by 2 to 6 hoist cables or belts, each of which is capable on its own of supporting the full load of the elevator plus twenty-five percent more weight.",1
Passenger elevators capacity is related to the available floor space.,1
"Generally passenger elevators are available in capacities from 500 to 2,700 kg in 230 kg increments.",1
"Generally passenger elevators in buildings of eight floors or fewer are hydraulic or electric, which can reach speeds up to 1 m/s hydraulic and up to 3 m/s electric.",1
See also the Elevators for urban transport section.,1
"Elevators may also have loudspeakers in them to play calm, easy listening music.",1
An express elevator does not serve all floors.,1
"Wheelchair, or platform elevators, a specialised type of elevator designed to move a wheelchair 3.7 m or less, can often accommodate just one person in a wheelchair at a time with a load of 340 kg.",1
"Freight elevators are generally required to display a written notice in the car that the use by passengers is prohibited, though certain freight elevators allow dual use through the use of an inconspicuous riser.",1
In order for an elevator to be legal to carry passengers in some jurisdictions it must have a solid inner door.,1
"Freight elevators are typically larger and capable of carrying heavier loads than a passenger elevator, generally from 2,300 to 4,500 kg.",1
"Freight elevators may have manually operated doors, and often have rugged interior finishes to prevent damage while loading and unloading.",1
"Although hydraulic freight elevators exist, Cable-Borne Elevators, or Traction Elevators are more energy efficient for the work of freight lifting, especially in taller buildings.",1
"Sidewalk elevators are used to move materials between a basement and a ground-level area, often the sidewalk just outside the building.",1
Sidewalk elevator cars feature a uniquely shaped top that allows this door to open and close automatically.,1
Most vehicle elevators have a weight capacity of 2 tons.,1
"Rare examples of extra-heavy elevators for 20-ton lorries, and even for railcars also occur.",1
"These elevators are designed for much greater capacity than other elevators, up to 91,000 kg of aircraft and equipment.",1
Smaller elevators lift munitions to the flight deck from magazines deep inside the ship.,1
"This allows an elevator to be installed where a traditional elevator may not fit, and simplifies installation.",1
"Machine-room-less elevators have been available commercially since the mid 1990s, however cost and overall size prevented their adoption to the residential elevator market until around 2010.Also, residential elevators are smaller than commercial elevators.",1
"The smallest passenger elevator is pneumatic, and it allows for only 1 person.",1
The smallest traction elevator allows for just 2 persons.,1
These elevators are often used in industrial and agricultural applications.,1
"Belt elevators are often used in docks for loading loose materials such as coal, iron ore and grain into the holds of bulk carriers
There have occasionally been belt lifts for humans; these typically have steps about every 2 m along the length of the belt, which moves vertically, so that the passenger can stand on one step and hold on to the one above.",1
"The elevator reversed this social stratification, exemplified by the modern penthouse suite.Early users of elevators sometimes reported nausea caused by abrupt stops while descending, and some users would use stairs to go down.",1
"If somebody waiting for the elevator wants to go up, but a car comes first that indicates that it is going down, then the person may decide not to get on the elevator.",1
"In addition to lanterns, most elevators have a chime to indicate if the elevator is going up or down either before or after the doors open, usually in conjunction with the lanterns lighting up.",1
"Observatory service elevators often convey other facts of interest, including elevator speed, stopwatch, and current position, as with the case for Taipei 101's service elevators.",1
Some elevator air conditioners can be used in countries with cold climates if a thermostat is used to reverse the refrigeration cycle to warm the elevator car.,1
"The elevator cab is ordinarily not air-tight, and some of this heat may reenter the car and reduce the overall cooling effect.",1
"However, by using an independent elevator air conditioner to achieve better temperature control inside the car, more energy will be used.",1
"National elevator standards:

Australia – AS1735
Canada – CAN/CSA B44

"In physics, energy is the quantitative property that must be transferred to an object in order to perform work on, or to heat, the object.",1
"Energy is a conserved quantity; the law of conservation of energy states that energy can be converted in form, but not created or destroyed.",1
"The SI unit of energy is the joule, which is the energy transferred to an object by the work of moving it a distance of 1 metre against a force of 1 newton.",1
"Common forms of energy include the kinetic energy of a moving object, the potential energy stored by an object's position in a force field, the elastic energy stored by stretching solid objects, the chemical energy released when a fuel burns, the radiant energy carried by light, and the thermal energy due to an object's temperature.",1
Mass and energy are closely related.,1
"Due to mass–energy equivalence, any object that has mass when stationary also has an equivalent amount of energy whose form is called rest energy, and any additional energy acquired by the object above that rest energy will increase the object's total mass just as it increases its total energy.",1
"Living organisms require energy to stay alive, such as the energy humans get from food.",1
"Human civilization requires energy to function, which it gets from  energy resources such as fossil fuels, nuclear fuel, or renewable energy.",1
"Kinetic energy is determined by the movement of an object – or the composite motion of the components of an object – and potential energy reflects the potential of an object to have motion, and generally is a function of the position of an object within a field or may be stored in the field itself.",1
"For example, macroscopic mechanical energy is the sum of translational and rotational kinetic and potential energy in a system neglects the kinetic energy due to temperature, and nuclear energy which combines utilize potentials from the nuclear force and the weak force), among others.",1
"Gustave-Gaspard Coriolis described ""kinetic energy"" in 1829 in its modern sense, and in 1853, William Rankine coined the term ""potential energy"".",1
"The law of conservation of energy was also first postulated in the early 19th century, and applies to any isolated system.",1
It is equal to the energy expended in applying a force of one newton through a distance of one metre.,1
"However energy is also expressed in many other units not part of the SI, such as ergs, calories, British Thermal Units, kilowatt-hours and kilocalories, which require a conversion factor when expressed in SI units.",1
"The SI unit of energy rate is the watt, which is a joule per second.",1
The CGS energy unit is the erg and the imperial and US customary unit is the foot pound.,1
"Other energy units such as the electronvolt, food calorie or thermodynamic kcal, and BTU are used in specific areas of science and commerce.",1
"Work, a function of energy, is force times distance.",1
Work and thus energy is frame dependent.,1
"The total energy of a system is sometimes called the Hamiltonian, after William Rowan Hamilton.",1
Some energy is transferred between the surroundings and the reactants of the reaction in the form of heat or light; thus the products of a reaction may have more or less energy than the reactants.,1
The activation energy necessary for a chemical reaction can be provided in the form of thermal energy.,1
"Energy used in respiration is mostly stored in molecular oxygen  and can be unlocked by reactions with molecules of substances such as carbohydrates, lipids, and proteins stored by cells.",1
"Release of the energy stored during photosynthesis as heat or light may be triggered suddenly by a spark, in a forest fire, or it may be made available more slowly for animal or human metabolism, when organic molecules are ingested, and catabolism is triggered by enzyme action.",1
"In growing organisms the energy that is converted to heat serves a vital purpose, as it allows the organism tissue to be highly ordered with regard to the molecules it is built from.",1
"Simpler organisms can achieve higher energy efficiencies than more complex ones, but the complex organisms can occupy ecological niches that are not available to their simpler brethren.",1
"This thermal energy drives plate tectonics and may lift mountains, via orogenesis.",1
"Energy in such transformations is either from gravitational collapse of matter into various classes of astronomical objects (stars, black holes, etc.",1
The Schrödinger equation equates the energy operator to the full energy of a particle or a system.,1
He called it rest energy: energy which every massive body must possess even when being at rest.,1
"The amount of energy is directly proportional to the mass of the body:

  
    
      
        
          E
          
            0

m is the mass of the body,
c is the speed of light in vacuum,

  
    
      
        
          E
          
            0
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle E_{0}}
   is the rest energy.For example, consider electron–positron annihilation, in which the rest energy of these two individual particles is converted to the radiant energy of the photons produced in the process.",1
"In general relativity, the stress–energy tensor serves as the source term for the gravitational field, in rough analogy to the way mass serves as the source term in the non-relativistic Newtonian approximation.Energy and mass are manifestations of one and the same underlying physical property of a system.",1
"In classical physics, energy is a scalar quantity, the canonical conjugate to time.",1
In special relativity energy is also a scalar.,1
"In other words, energy is invariant with respect to rotations of space, but not invariant with respect to rotations of space-time.",1
"Examples of energy transformation include generating electric energy from heat energy via a steam turbine, or lifting an object against gravity using electrical energy driving a crane motor.",1
"Our Sun transforms nuclear potential energy to other forms of energy; its total mass does not decrease due to that in itself, but its mass does decrease when the energy escapes out to its surroundings, largely as radiant energy.",1
"However, some energy transformations can be quite efficient.",1
The direction of transformations in energy is often determined by entropy considerations.,1
"In practice all energy transformations are permitted on a small scale, but certain larger transformations are not permitted because it is statistically unlikely that energy or matter will randomly move into more concentrated forms or smaller spaces.",1
"Energy transformations in the universe over time are characterized by various kinds of potential energy that has been available since the Big Bang later being ""released"" when a triggering mechanism is available.",1
This energy is triggered and released in nuclear fission bombs or in civil nuclear power generation.,1
Energy is also transferred from potential energy to kinetic energy and then back to potential energy constantly.,1
"In this closed system, energy cannot be created or destroyed; therefore, the initial energy and the final energy will be equal to each other.",1
"Then the total amount of energy can be found by adding 
  
    
      
        
          E

  .",1
"Part of the rest energy of matter may be converted to other forms of energy, but neither energy nor mass can be destroyed; rather, both remain constant during any process.",1
"For example, conversion of energy from one type of potential field to another, is reversible, as in the pendulum system described above.",1
"In this case, the energy must partly stay as heat, and cannot be completely recovered as usable energy, except at the price of an increase in some other kind of heat-like increase in disorder in quantum states, in the universe.",1
"In this heat death the energy of the universe does not change, but the fraction of energy which is available to do work through a heat engine, or be transformed to other usable forms of energy, grows less and less.",1
"The total inflow of energy into a system must equal the total outflow of energy from the system, plus the change in the energy contained within the system.",1
"Whenever one measures the total energy of a system of particles whose interactions do not depend explicitly on time, it is found that the total energy of the system always remains constant.While heat can always be fully converted into work in a reversible isothermal expansion of an ideal gas, for cyclic processes of practical interest in heat engines the second law of thermodynamics states that the system doing work always loses some energy as waste heat.",1
Mechanical and other forms of energy can be transformed in the other direction into thermal energy without such limitations.,1
The total energy of a system can be calculated by adding up all forms of energy in the system.,1
Most kinds of energy are subject to strict local conservation laws as well.,1
"In this case, energy can only be exchanged between adjacent regions of space, and all observers agree as to the volumetric density of energy in any given space.",1
This is because energy is the quantity which is canonical conjugate to time.,1
This mathematical entanglement of energy and time also results in the uncertainty principle - it is impossible to define the exact amount of energy during any definite time interval.,1
"Likewise, whenever energy is transferred between systems by any mechanism, an associated mass is transferred with it.",1
In quantum mechanics energy is expressed using the Hamiltonian operator.,1
The portion of the energy which is transferred by conservative forces over a distance is measured as the work the source system does on the receiving system.,1
The portion of the energy which does not do work during the transfer is called heat.,1
Energy can be transferred between systems in a variety of ways.,1
Energy is strictly conserved and is also locally conserved wherever it can be defined.,1
It is the energy needed to create the system.,1
Gas is one of the four fundamental states of matter.,1
A pure gas may be made up of individual atoms (e.g.,1
"a noble gas like neon), elemental molecules made from one type of atom (e.g.",1
"A gas mixture, such as air, contains a variety of pure gases.",1
What distinguishes a gas from liquids and solids is the vast separation of the individual gas particles.,1
"The interaction of gas particles in the presence of  electric and  gravitational fields are considered negligible, as indicated by the constant velocity vectors in the image.",1
"The gaseous state of matter occurs between the liquid and plasma states, the latter of which provides the upper temperature boundary for gases.",1
High-density atomic gases super-cooled to very low temperatures are classified by their statistical behavior as either Bose gases or Fermi gases.,1
"This was because certain gases suggested a supernatural origin, such as from their ability to cause death, extinguish flames, and to occur in ""mines, bottom of wells, churchyards and other lonely places"".",1
"Gas particles are widely separated from one another, and consequently, have weaker intermolecular bonds than liquids or solids.",1
"Like-charged areas of different gas particles repel, while oppositely charged regions of different gas particles attract one another; gases that contain permanently charged ions are known as plasmas.",1
"Gaseous compounds with polar covalent bonds contain permanent charge imbalances and so experience relatively strong intermolecular forces, although the molecule while the compound's net charge remains neutral.",1
"Finally, gas particles spread apart or diffuse in order to homogeneously distribute themselves throughout any container.",1
"Macroscopically, the gas characteristics measured are either in terms of the gas particles themselves or their surroundings.",1
"This relationship held for every gas that Boyle observed leading to the law,, named to honor his work in this field.",1
"As gases are subjected to extreme conditions, these tools become more complex, from the Euler equations  for inviscid flow to the Navier–Stokes equations that fully account for viscous effects.",1
"In this flight regime, the gas is no longer behaving ideally.",1
"When describing a container of gas, the term pressure refers to the average force per unit area that the gas exerts on the surface of the container.",1
The force imparted by a gas particle into the container during this collision is the change in momentum of the particle.,1
The speed of a gas particle is proportional to its absolute temperature.,1
"Kinetic energy added to gas particles by way of collisions produces linear, rotational, and vibrational motion.",1
These heated gas molecules have a greater speed range which constantly varies due to constant collisions with other particles.,1
1000 atoms a gas occupy the same space as any other 1000 atoms for any given temperature and pressure.,1
"Since gas molecules can move freely within a container, their mass is normally characterized by density.",1
"For gases, the density can vary over a wide range because the particles are free to move closer together when constrained by pressure or volume.",1
"For a static gas, the density is the same throughout the entire container.",1
These neutral gas particles only change direction when they collide with another particle or with the sides of the container.,1
"In an ideal gas, these collisions are perfectly elastic.",1
"For example, as a gas is heated from absolute zero, when it is perfectly still, its internal energy is increased.",1
"As a gas is heated, the particles speed up and its temperature rises.",1
"The gas particle animation, using pink and green particles, illustrates how this behavior results in the spreading out of gases.",1
Proper use of these gas relationships requires the kinetic-molecular theory.,1
When gas particles experience intermolecular forces they gradually influence one another as the spacing between them is reduced.,1
Real gases experience some of these collisions and intermolecular forces.,1
If the gas particles are compressed into close proximity they behave more like a liquid.,1
"The ""gas models"" that are most widely discussed are ""perfect gas"", ""ideal gas"" and ""real gas"".",1
"This notation is the ""gas dynamicist's"" version, which is more practical in modeling of gas flows involving acceleration without chemical reactions.",1
The ideal gas law does not make an assumption about the specific heat of a gas.,1
"For an ideal gas, the ideal gas law applies without restrictions on the specific heat.",1
"An ideal gas is a simplified ""real gas"" with the assumption that the compressibility factor Z is set to 1 meaning that this pneumatic ratio remains constant.",1
"An example where the ""ideal gas approximation"" would be suitable would be inside a combustion chamber of a jet engine.",1
"As the density of a gas increases with rising pressure, the intermolecular forces play a more substantial role in gas behavior which results in the ideal gas law no longer providing ""reasonable"" results.",1
"Real gas effects include those adjustments made to account for a greater range of gas behavior:

Compressibility effects
Variable heat capacity
Van der Waals forces
Non-equilibrium thermodynamic effects
Issues with molecular dissociation and elementary reactions with variable composition.For most applications, such a detailed analysis is excessive.",1
Examples where real gas effects would have a significant impact would be on the Space Shuttle re-entry where extremely high temperatures and pressures were present or the gases produced during geological events as in the image of the 1990 eruption of Mount Redoubt.,1
Then the volume of gas was carefully measured as additional mercury was added to the tube.,1
"The pressure of the gas could be determined by the difference between the mercury level in the short end of the tube and that in the long, open end.",1
"For his work with gases a century prior, the number that bears his name Avogadro's constant represents the number of atoms found in 12 grams of elemental carbon-12.",1
"This specific number of gas particles, at standard temperature and pressure occupies 22.40 liters, which is referred to as the molar volume.",1
Gas particle identity played no role in determining final pressure.,1
"While a gas has a lower value of viscosity than a liquid, it is still an observable property.",1
"If gases had no viscosity, then they would not stick to the surface of a wing and form a boundary layer.",1

"Rapid deployment of renewable energy and energy efficiency technologies is resulting in significant energy security, climate change mitigation, and economic benefits.",1
"As most of renewable energy technologies provide electricity, renewable energy deployment is often applied in conjunction with further electrification, which has several benefits: electricity can be converted to heat, can be converted into mechanical energy with high efficiency, and is clean at the point of consumption.",1
"In addition, electrification with renewable energy is more efficient and therefore leads to significant reductions in primary energy requirements.",1
"Renewable energy resources and significant opportunities for energy efficiency exist over wide geographical areas, in contrast to other energy sources, which are concentrated in a limited number of countries.",1
"Rapid deployment of renewable energy and energy efficiency, and technological diversification of energy sources, would result in significant energy security and economic benefits.",1
"Renewable energy sources, that derive their energy from the sun, either directly or indirectly, such as hydro and wind, are expected to be capable of supplying humanity energy for almost another 1 billion years, at which point the predicted increase in heat from the Sun is expected to make the surface of the Earth too hot for liquid water to exist.Climate change and global warming concerns, coupled with the continuing fall in the costs of some renewable energy equipment, such as wind turbines and solar panels, are driving increased use of renewables.",1
"National renewable energy markets are projected to continue to grow strongly in the coming decade and beyond, and some 120 countries have various policy targets for longer-term shares of renewable energy, including a 20% target of all electricity generated for the European Union by 2020.",1
"In 2017, investments in renewable energy amounted to US$279.8 billion worldwide, with China accounting for US$126.6 billion or 45% of the global investments, the US for US$40.5 billion, and Europe for US$40.9 billion.",1
"Renewable energy costs continue to drop, and the levelised cost of electricity is declining for wind power, solar photovoltaic, concentrated solar power and some biomass technologies.",1
Renewable energy is also the most economic solution for new grid-connected capacity in areas with good resources.,1
Renewable energy can be particularly suitable for developing countries.,1
Producing renewable energy locally can offer a viable alternative.Technology advances are opening up a huge new market for solar power: the approximately 1.3 billion people around the world who don't have access to grid electricity.,1
"Renewable energy technologies can also make indirect contributions to alleviating poverty by providing energy for cooking, space heating, and lighting.",1
"Renewable energy can also contribute to education, by providing electricity to schools.",1
Renewable energy use has grown much faster than even advocates anticipated.,1
"Barriers to implementing the renewable energy plan are seen to be ""primarily social and political, not technological or economic"".",1
"More than 2000 renewable energy facilities are built, and more are under construction, in areas of environmental importance and threaten the habitats of plant and animal species across the globe.",1
"The key is ensuring that renewable energy facilities are built in places where they do not damage biodiversity.Manufacturing of photovoltaic panels, wind turbines and batteries requires significant amounts of rare-earth elements and increases mining operations, which have social and environmental impact.",1
"A wind turbine, or alternatively referred to as a wind energy converter, is a device that converts the wind's kinetic energy into electrical energy.",1
Wind turbines are manufactured  in a wide range of vertical and horizontal axis.,1
Advanced wind turbines were described by Croatian inventor Fausto Veranzio.,1
"The first electricity-generating wind turbine was a battery charging machine installed in July 1887 by Scottish academic James Blyth to light his holiday home in Marykirk, Scotland.",1
"The Smith–Putnam wind turbine only ran for 1,100 hours before suffering a critical failure.",1
"The first utility grid-connected wind turbine to operate in the UK was built by John Brown & Company in 1951 in the Orkney Islands.Despite these diverse developments, developments in fossil fuel systems almost entirely eliminated any wind turbine systems larger than supermicro size.",1
"Analysis of 3128 wind turbines older than 10 years in Denmark showed that half of the turbines had no decrease, while the other half saw a production decrease of 1.2% per year.",1
"However, wind turbine wakes have been found to recover faster under unstable atmospheric conditions as opposed to a stable environment.Different materials have been found to have varying effects on the efficiency of wind turbines.",1
Offshore wind turbines are built up to 8 MW today and have a blade length up to 80 meters.,1
A 1.5 wind turbine of a type frequently seen in the United States has a tower 80 meters high.,1
Dynamic characteristics of non-rotating wind turbines have been measured using digital image correlation and photogrammetry.,1
"Typically, the glass/epoxy composites for wind turbine blades contain up to 75% glass by weight.",1

Information can be thought of as the resolution of uncertainty; it is that which answers the question of ""what an entity is"" and thus defines both its essence and nature of its characteristics.",1
The concept of information has different meanings in different contexts.,1
"Information is associated with data, as data represents values attributed to parameters, and information is data in context and with meaning attached.",1
"Information also relates to knowledge, as knowledge signifies understanding of an abstract or concrete concept.In terms of communication, information is expressed either as the content of a message or through direct or indirect observation.",1
Information can be encoded into various forms for transmission and interpretation.,1

Some information is important because of association with other information but eventually there must be a connection to a causal input.,1
"In practice, information is usually carried by weak stimuli that must be detected by specialized sensory systems and amplified by energy inputs before they can be functional to the organism or system.",1
"For example, Gregory Bateson defines ""information"" as a ""difference that makes a difference"".If, however, the premise of ""influence"" implies that information has been perceived by a conscious mind and also interpreted by it, the specific context associated with this interpretation may cause the transformation of the information into knowledge.",1
"Complex definitions of both ""information"" and ""knowledge"" make such semantic and logical analysis difficult, but the condition of ""transformation"" is an important point in the study of information as it relates to knowledge, especially in the business discipline of knowledge management.",1

"Maglev is a system of train transportation that uses two sets of magnets, one set to repel and push the train up off the track, and another set to move the elevated train ahead, taking advantage of the lack of friction.",1
"Along certain ""medium-range"" routes, maglev can compete favorably with high-speed rail and airplanes.",1
"With maglev technology, there is just one moving part: the train itself.",1
Maglev trains are therefore quieter and smoother than conventional trains and have the potential for much higher speeds.Maglev vehicles have set several speed records and maglev trains can accelerate and decelerate much faster than conventional trains; the only practical limitation is the safety and comfort of the passengers.,1
"Maglev systems have been much more expensive to construct than conventional train systems, although the simpler construction of maglev vehicles makes them cheaper to manufacture and maintain.The Shanghai maglev train, also known as the Shanghai Transrapid, has a top speed of 430 km/h.",1
"The incremental benefits of maglev technology have often been considered hard to justify against cost and risk, especially where there is an existing or proposed conventional high-speed train line with spare passenger carrying capacity, as in high-speed rail in Europe, the High Speed 2 in the UK and Shinkansen in Japan.",1
"The first commercial maglev people mover was simply called ""MAGLEV"" and officially opened in 1984 near Birmingham, England.",1
"An early maglev train was described in U.S. Patent 3,158,765, ""Magnetic system of transportation"", by G. R. Polgreen.",1
"The first use of ""maglev"" in a United States patent was in ""Magnetic levitation guidance system"" by Canadian Patents and Development Limited.",1
Maglev trains on the Miyazaki test track regularly hit 517 km/h by 1979.,1
"In Okazaki, Japan, the SCMaglev was used for test rides at the Okazaki exhibition.",1
The construction of a maglev track using the technology from Ramenskoye started in Armenian SSR in 1987 and was planned to be completed in 1991.,1
"In 2006, the Lathen maglev train accident occurred, killing 23 people.",1
It was a driverless maglev system with a 1.6 km track connecting three stations.,1
Maglev systems may be monorail or dual rail—the SCMaglev MLX01 for instance uses a trench-like track—and not all monorail trains are maglevs.,1
"Maglev tracks, monorail or not, can also be constructed at grade or underground in tunnels.",1
"Conversely, non-maglev tracks, monorail or not, can be elevated or underground too.",1
Some maglev trains do incorporate wheels and function like linear motor-propelled wheeled vehicles at slower speeds but levitate at higher speeds.,1
"The two main types of maglev technology are:

Electromagnetic suspension, electronically controlled electromagnets in the train attract it to a magnetically conductive track.",1
"In the early stages of maglev development at the Miyazaki test track, a purely repulsive system was used instead of the later repulsive and attractive EDS system.",1
A major advantage of EDS maglev systems is that they are dynamically stable—changes in distance between the track and the magnets creates strong forces to return the system to its original position.,1
All operational implementations of maglev technology make minimal use of wheeled train technology and are not compatible with conventional rail tracks.,1
The SPM maglev system is inter-operable with steel rail tracks and would permit maglev vehicles and conventional trains to operate on the same tracks.,1
"Because maglev vehicles essentially fly, stabilisation of pitch, roll and yaw is required.",1
"Speed: Maglev allows higher top speeds than conventional rail, but experimental wheel-based high-speed trains have demonstrated similar speeds.",1
Maintenance: Maglev trains currently in operation have demonstrated the need for minimal guideway maintenance.,1
"Weather: Maglev trains are little affected by snow, ice, severe cold, rain or high winds.",1
Maglev vehicles accelerate and decelerate faster than mechanical systems regardless of the slickness of the guideway or the slope of the grade because they are non-contact systems.,1
"Track: Maglev trains are not compatible with conventional track, and therefore require custom infrastructure for their entire route.",1
"John Harding, former chief maglev scientist at the Federal Railroad Administration, claimed that separate maglev infrastructure more than pays for itself with higher levels of all-weather operational availability and nominal maintenance costs.",1
"A 50-ton Transrapid maglev vehicle can lift an additional 20 tons, for a total of 70 tons, which consumes 70–140 kW.",1
Maglev cars are lighter and distribute weight more evenly.,1
Two maglev system microwave towers are in constant contact with trains.,1
"Terrain: Maglevs are able to ascend higher grades, offering more routing flexibility and reduced tunneling.",1
This can make maglevs more efficient per kilometer.,1
Routing: Maglevs offer competitive journey times for distances of 800 km or less.,1
"Additionally, maglevs can easily serve intermediate destinations.",1
Availability: Maglevs are little affected by weather.,1
"Travel time: Maglevs do not face the extended security protocols faced by air travelers nor is time consumed for taxiing, or for queuing for take-off and landing.",1
"A Tokaido maglev route replacing the current Shinkansen would cost 1/10 the cost, as no new tunnel would be needed, but noise pollution issues made this infeasible.The Japanese Linimo HSST, cost approximately US$100 million/km to build.",1
"As more maglev systems are deployed, experts expected construction costs to drop by employing new construction methods and from economies of scale.",1
No maglev or wheel-rail commercial operation has actually been attempted at speeds over 500 km/h.,1
Other US urban maglev demonstration projects of note are the LEVX in Washington State and the Massachusetts-based Magplane.,1
"This Shanghai Maglev Train demonstration line, or Initial Operating Segment, has been in commercial operations since April 2004 and now operates 115 daily trips that traverse the 30 km between the two stations in 7 or 8 minutes, achieving a top speed of 431 km/h and averaging 266 km/h.",1
The Shanghai maglev is faster than Birmingham technology and comes with on-time—to the second—reliability greater than 99.97%.Plans to extend the line to Shanghai South Railway Station and Hongqiao Airport on the northwestern edge of Shanghai are on hold.,1
Government research on urban maglev using electromagnetic suspension began in 1994.,1
The first operating urban maglev was UTM-02 in Daejeon beginning on 21 April 2008 after 14 years of development and one prototype; UTM-01.,1
The maglev would service a population of over 4 million and the proposal was costed at A$8 billion.,1
"The minimal vibration of maglev would also be suitable to provide access Hsinchu Science Park, where sensitive silicon foundries are located.",1
"Baltimore – Washington D.C. Maglev: Baltimore-Washington Superconducting Maglev Project of 64 km has been proposed linking Cherry Hill or Camden Yards in Baltimore, Baltimore-Washington International Airport and Mt.",1
"The maglev line would run along Highway PR-52, connecting both cities.",1
According to American Maglev project cost would be approximately US$380 million.,1
"In the case of maglev trains, an incident could result from human error, including loss of power, or factors outside human control, such as ground movement, for example, caused by an earthquake.",1

"Pricing is the process whereby a business sets the price at which it will sell its products and services, and may be part of the business's marketing plan.",1
"Pricing is a fundamental aspect of financial modeling and is one of the four Ps of the marketing mix, the other three aspects being product, promotion, and place.",1
"Pricing can be a manual or automatic process of applying prices to purchase and sales orders, based on factors such as: a fixed amount, quantity break, promotion or sales campaign, specific vendor quote, price prevailing on entry, shipment or invoice date, combination of multiple orders or lines, and many others.",1
Automated pricing systems require more setup and maintenance but may prevent pricing errors.,1
"Thus, pricing is the most important concept in the field of marketing, it is used as a tactical decision in response to changing competitive, market and organisational situations.",1
A good pricing strategy would be the one which could balance between the price floor and the price ceiling.,1
This pricing strategy typically becomes part of the company's overall long-term strategic plan.,1
"The pricing strategy established the overall, long-term goals of the pricing function, without specifying an actual price-point.Broadly, there are six approaches to pricing strategy mentioned in the marketing literature:

Operations-oriented pricing: where the objective is to optimise productive capacity, to achieve operational efficiencies or to match supply and demand through varying prices.",1
"For example, dynamic pricing is a form of revenue oriented pricing.Customer-oriented pricing: where the objective is to maximize the number of customers; encourage cross-selling opportunities or to recognise different levels in the customer's ability to pay.Value-based pricing: occurs where the company uses prices to signal market value or associates price with the desired value position in the mind of the buyer.",1
The aim of value-based pricing is to reinforce the overall positioning strategy e.g.,1
premium pricing posture to pursue or maintain a luxury image.Relationship-oriented pricing: where the marketer sets prices in order to build or maintain relationships with existing or potential customers.Socially-oriented pricing: Where the objective is to encourage or discourage specific social attitudes and behaviours.,1
"Tactical pricing decisions are shorter term prices, designed to accomplish specific short-term goals.",1
"The tactical approach to pricing may vary from time to time, depending on a range of internal considerations (e.g.",1
a response to competitive pricing tactics).,1
"Accordingly, a number of different pricing tactics may be employed in the course of a single planning period or across a single year.",1
Contingency pricing is widely used in professional services such as legal services and consultancy services.,1
"This method of pricing is often used in B2B contexts where the purchasing officer may be authorised to make purchases up to a predetermined level, beyond which decisions must go to a committee for authorisation.",1
"The objective of honeymoon pricing is to ""lock"" customers into a long-term association with the vendor.",1
"Peak and off-peak pricing is widely used in tourism, travel and also in utilities such as electricity providers.",1
"Peak pricing has caught the public's imagination since the ride-sharing service provider, Uber, commenced using surge pricing and has sought to patent the technologies that support this approach.",1
This type of pricing is designed to signal that the resort is a family friendly operation.,1
"Promotional pricing is sometimes a reaction to unforeseen circumstances, as when a downturn in demand leaves a company with excess stocks; or when competitive activity is making inroads into market share or profits.",1
Two part pricing breaks the actual price into two parts; a fixed service fee plus a variable consumption rate.,1
"Two- part pricing tactics are widely used by utility companies such as electricity, gas and water and services  where there is a quasi- membership type relationship, credit cards where an annual fee is charged and theme parks where an entrance fee is charged for admission while the customer pays for rides and extras.",1
Psychological pricing is widely used in a variety of retail settings.,1
The high pricing of a premium product is used to enhance and reinforce a product's luxury image.,1
This phenomenon enables premium pricing opportunities for marketers in luxury markets.,1
"Pricing factors are manufacturing cost, market place, competition, market condition, quality of product.",1
Uber's pricing policy is an example of demand-based dynamic pricing.,1
"Pricing can be approached at three levels: the industry, market, and transaction level.",1
"Pricing at the industry level focuses on the overall economics of the industry, including supplier price changes and customer demand changes.",1
Pricing at the market level focuses on the competitive position of the price in comparison to the value differential of the product to that of comparative competing products.,1
"Pricing at the transaction level focuses on managing the implementation of discounts away from the reference, or list price, which occur both on and off the invoice or receipt.A ""price waterfall"" analysis helps businesses and sales personnel to understand the differences which arise between the reference or list price, the invoiced sale price and the actual price paid by a customer taking account of contract, sales and payment discounts.",1
"Jerry Bernstein's article Use Suppliers' Pricing Mistakes  outlines several sales errors, which include:

Weak controls on discounting
Inadequate systems for tracking competitors' selling prices and market share
Cost-plus pricing
Price increases poorly executed
Worldwide price inconsistencies
Paying sales representatives on sales volume vs. addition of revenue measuresContrary to common misconception, price is not the most important factor for consumers, when deciding to buy a product.",1

"Any broadminded humanist project involves interdisciplinarity, and history shows a crowd of cases, as seventeenth-century Leibniz's task to create a system of universal justice, which required linguistics, economics, management, ethics, law philosophy, politics, and even sinology.Interdisciplinary programs sometimes arise from a shared conviction that the traditional disciplines are unable or unwilling to address an important problem.",1
"At another level, interdisciplinarity is seen as a remedy to the harmful effects of excessive specialization and isolation in information silos.",1
"On some views, however, interdisciplinarity is entirely indebted to those who specialize in one field of study—that is, without specialists, interdisciplinarians would have no information and no leading experts to consult.",1
"Others place the focus of interdisciplinarity on the need to transcend disciplines, viewing excessive specialization as problematic both epistemologically and politically.",1
"In contrast, studies of interdisciplinarity raise to self-consciousness questions about how interdisciplinarity works, the nature and history of disciplinarity, and the future of knowledge in post-industrial society.",1

"A theatre director or stage director is a professional in the theatre field who oversees and orchestrates the mounting of a theatre production such as a play, opera, dance-drama, musical theatre performance etc.",1
"The modern theatre director can be said to have originated in the staging of elaborate spectacles of the Meininger Company under George II, Duke of Saxe-Meiningen.",1
A more common term for theatre director in French is metteur en scène.,1
"In Britain, the tradition that theatre directors emerge from degree courses at the Oxbridge universities has meant that for a long time, professional vocational training did not take place at drama schools or performing arts colleges, although an increase in training programmes for theatre directors can be witnessed since the 1970s and 1980s.",1
A playwright or dramatist is a person who writes plays.,1
"Playwright, I loath to have thy manners known
In my chaste book ; I profess them in thine own.Jonson described himself as a poet, not a playwright, since plays during that time were written in meter and so were regarded as the province of poets.",1
"The term ""playwright"" later again lost this negative connotation.",1
"This meant that the playwright had to construct the play so that its ""virtual"" time would not exceed 24 hours, that it would be restricted to a single setting, and that there would be no subplots.",1
"For example, Playwrights Horizons produced only six plays in the 2002–03 seasons, compared with thirty-one in 1973–74.",1
"A dramaturge or dramaturg is a literary adviser or editor in a theatre, opera, or film company who researches, selects, adapts, edits, and interprets scripts, libretti, texts, and printed programmes, consults authors, and does public relations work.",1

"Scenic design is the creation of theatrical, as well as film or television scenery.",1
"Scenic designers come from a variety of artistic backgrounds, but in recent years, are mostly trained professionals, holding a B.F.A.",1
Scenic designers design sets and scenery that aim to support the overall artistic goals of the production.,1
The scenic designer works with the director and other designers to establish an overall visual concept for the production and design the stage environment.,1
"In the process of planning, scenic designers often make models, ranging from very basic to extremely complex.",1
"Scenic designers are responsible for creating scale models of the scenery, renderings, paint elevations and scale construction drawings as part of their communication with other production staff.",1
"A scenographer or production designer, develops the appearance of a stage design, a TV or movie set, a gaming environment, a trade fair exhibition design or a museum experience exhibition design.",1
"A scenographer works together with the theater director to make the message come through in the best way they think possible, the director having the leading role and responsibility particularly for dramatic aspects - such as casting, acting, and direction - and the scenographer primarily responsible for the visual aspects or ""look"" of the production - which often includes scenery or sets, lighting, and costumes, and may include projections or other aspects.",1
"A theatre lighting designer works with the director, choreographer, set designer, costume designer, and sound designer to create the lighting, atmosphere, and time of day for the production in response to the text, while keeping in mind issues of visibility,  safety, and cost.",1
"The lighting designer uses this paperwork to aid in the visualization of not only ideas but simple lists to assist the Master Electrician during load-in, focus and technical rehearsals.",1
"The lighting designer is responsible, in conjunction with the production's independently hired ""Production Electrician"" who will interface with the theatre's Master Electrician, for directing the theatre's electrics crew in the realization of his or her designs during the technical rehearsals.",1
"The lighting designer will work constantly with the board operator to refine the lighting states as the technical rehearsal continues, but because the focus of a ""tech"" rehearsal is the production's technical aspects, the LD may require the performers to pause frequently.",1
"The lighting designer, in this situation, commonly works directly with this small team, fulfilling the role of both master electrician and lighting designer.",1
The lighting designer may also take on other roles in addition to lights when they are finished hanging lights and programming cues on the board.,1
"The lighting designer enters the light plot into the visualization software and then enters the ground plan of the theater and set design, giving as much three-dimensional data as possible.",1
This gives the lighting designer the ability to mock up real time lighting effects as they will look during the show.,1
"A costume designer is a person who designs costumes for a film, stage production or television show.",1
"The role of the costume designer is to create the characters' outfits/costumes and balance the scenes with texture and colour, etc.",1

"The costume designer may also collaborate with hair stylist, wig master, or makeup artist.",1
Sound design is the art and practice of creating sound tracks for a variety of needs.,1
Sound design commonly involves performing (see e.g.,1
A sound designer is one who practices sound design.,1
"Whilst the term ""sound designer"" was not in use at this time, a number of stage managers specialised as ""effects men"", creating and performing offstage sound effects using a mix of vocal mimicry, mechanical and electrical contraptions and gramophone records.",1
The terms sound design and sound designer began to be used in the motion picture industry in 1969.,1
The term sound designer has replaced monikers like supervising sound editor or re-recording mixer for what was essentially the same position: the head designer of the final sound track.,1
"The position of Sound Designer therefore emerged in a manner similar to that of Production Designer, which was created in the 1930s when William Cameron Menzies made revolutionary contributions to the craft of art direction in the making of Gone with the Wind.The audio production team is a principal member of the production staff, with creative output comparable to that of the film editor and director of photography.",1
The development of film sound design is giving writers and directors higher expectations and knowledge of sound design.,1
"Consequently, theatre sound design is widespread and accomplished sound designers commonly establish long-term collaborations with directors.",1
"While sound design for a musical largely focuses on the artistic merits of sound reinforcement, many musicals, such as Into the Woods also require significant sound scores.",1
The sound designer for a play and the production's director work together to decide the themes and emotions to be explored.,1
"Based on this, the sound designer for plays, in collaboration with the director and possibly the composer, decides upon the sounds that will be used to create the desired moods.",1
"In some productions, the sound designer might also be hired to compose music for the play.",1
"The sound designer and the director usually work together to ""spot"" the cues in the play.",1
"Some sound designers are accomplished composers, writing and producing music for productions as well as designing sound.",1
Many sound designs for plays also require significant sound reinforcement.,1

"A composer may create music in any music genre, including, for example, classical music, musical theatre, blues, folk music, jazz, and popular music.",1
Composers often express their works in a written musical score using musical notation.,1
"Many composers are, or were, also skilled performers of music.",1
"Composers and songwriters who present their own music are interpreting, just as much as those who perform the music of others.",1
"Because of this trend of composers becoming increasingly specific and detailed in their instructions to the performer, a culture eventually developed whereby faithfulness to the composer's written intention came to be highly valued.",1
"In Western art music, the composer typically orchestrates his or her own compositions, but in musical theatre and in pop music, songwriters may hire an arranger to do the orchestration.",1
"The term ""composer"" is often used to refer to composers of instrumental music, such as those found in classical, jazz or other forms of art and traditional music.",1

"Many leading important composers came from the Netherlands, Belgium, and northern France.",1
They are called the Franco-Flemish composers.,1
Another key style of music composers used during this era was contrapuntal music.,1
"This style of writing required composers to have an advanced knowledge of music theory, as contrapuntal music involves multiple, independent melody lines played by instruments or sung by voices.",1
"German Baroque composers wrote for small ensembles including strings, brass, and woodwinds, as well as choirs and for keyboard instruments such as pipe organ, harpsichord, and clavichord.",1
"During this period, composers developed several major music forms that lasted into later periods when they were expanded and evolved further, including the fugue, the invention, the sonata, and the concerto.",1
"Some of the best-known composers from the Baroque era include Claudio Monteverdi, Heinrich Schütz, Jean-Baptiste Lully, Dieterich Buxtehude, Arcangelo Corelli, Henry Purcell, François Couperin, Antonio Vivaldi, Georg Philipp Telemann, Jean-Philippe Rameau, Johann Sebastian Bach and George Frideric Handel.",1

"For composers, the emotional and expressive qualities of music came to take precedence over following textbooks and tradition.",1
"Romantic composers grew in idiosyncrasy, and went further in the syncretism of exploring different art-forms in a musical context,, history, or nature itself.",1
"In many cases, composers explored new approaches to use for existing genres, forms, and functions.",1
"Also, composers created new forms that were deemed better suited to the new subject matter.",1
"Later Romantic composers such as Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky, Antonín Dvořák, and Gustav Mahler used more unusual chords and more dissonance to create dramatic tension.",1
"During the late Romantic period, composers explored dramatic chromatic alterations of tonality, such as extended chords and altered chords, which created new sound ""colours"".",1
"Composers in the Romantic era increased the size of the orchestra by adding players and using new instruments, creating a more powerful sound.",1
"Based on over 12,000 prominent composers listed in Grove Music Online and using word count measurement techniques, the most important cities for classical music can be quantitatively identified.Paris has been the main hub for classical music in all periods.",1

"In melodramas, men are shown in the domestic, stereotypically female home environment; as such, to resolve the challenges presented by the story, the male must learn to negotiate this ""female"" space.",1
"Melodramas place their attention on a victim character.Since melodramas are set in the home and in a small town, it can be challenging for the filmmaker to create a sense of action given that it all takes place in one claustrophobic sphere; one way to add in more locations is through flashbacks to the past.The sense of being trapped often causes challenges for children, teen and female characters.",1
"Melodramas focus on women's subjectivity and perspective and female desire; however, due to the Hay's Code, this desire could not be explicitly shown on screen from the 1930s to the late 1960s, so female desire is de-eroticized.During the 1940s the British Gainsborough melodramas were successful with audiences.",1

"Among the factors that shaped modernism were the development of modern industrialism, the rapid growth of cities, and the horrors of World War I.",1

Others focus on modernism as an aesthetic introspection.,1

"Everdell also thinks modernism in painting began in 1885–1886 with Seurat's Divisionism, the ""dots"" used to paint A Sunday Afternoon on the Island of La Grande Jatte.",1
"However, the relationship of Modernism with tradition was complex, as literary scholar Peter Childs indicates: ""There were paradoxical if not opposed trends towards revolutionary and reactionary positions, fear of the new and delight at the disappearance of the old, nihilism and fanatical enthusiasm, creativity and despair.",1
"At this time though modernism was still ""progressive"", increasingly it saw traditional forms and traditional social arrangements as hindering progress, and was recasting the artist as a revolutionary, engaged in overthrowing rather than enlightening society.",1
"Therefore, modernism's view of reality, which had been a minority taste before the war, became more generally accepted in the 1920s.",1
"This aspect of modernism has often seemed a reaction to consumer culture, which developed in Europe and North America in the late 19th century.",1

"Clement Greenberg sees modernism ending in the 1930s, with the exception of the visual and performing arts, but with regard to music, Paul Griffiths notes that, while Modernism ""seemed to be a spent force"" by the late 1920s, after World War II, ""a new generation of composers—Boulez, Barraqué, Babbitt, Nono, Stockhausen, Xenakis"" revived modernism"".",1

"Postmodernism is essentially a centralized movement that named itself, based on sociopolitical theory, although the term is now used in a wider sense to refer to activities from the 20th century onwards which exhibit awareness of and reinterpret the modern.Postmodern theory asserts that the attempt to canonise Modernism ""after the fact"" is doomed to undisambiguable contradictions.In a narrower sense, what was Modernist was not necessarily also postmodern.",1
Those elements of Modernism which accentuated the benefits of rationality and socio-technological progress were only Modernist.,1
"However, high modernism began to merge with consumer culture after World War II, especially during the 1960s.",1
"Some writers declared that modernism had become so institutionalized that it was now ""post avant-garde"", indicating that it had lost its power as a revolutionary movement.",1

"Ballet has been taught in various schools around the world, which have historically incorporated their own cultures and as a result, the art has evolved in a number of distinct ways.",1
"A ballet, a work, consists of the choreography and music for a ballet production.",1
Ballets are choreographed and performed by trained ballet dancers.,1
"Traditional classical ballets are usually performed with classical music accompaniment and use elaborate costumes and staging, whereas modern ballets, such as the neoclassical works of American choreographer George Balanchine, are often performed in simple costumes and without the use of elaborate sets or scenery.",1
Pierre Beauchamp served as Lully's ballet-master.,1
"Examples of this are Russian ballet, French ballet, and Italian ballet.",1
"Later variations, such as contemporary ballet and neoclassical ballet, incorporate both classical ballet and non-traditional technique and movement.",1
"Several of the classical ballet styles are associated with specific training methods, typically named after their creators.",1
"Some examples of classical ballet productions are: Swan Lake, The Sleeping Beauty and The Nutcracker.",1
The plots of many romantic ballets revolved around spirit women who enslaved the hearts and senses of mortal men.,1
"The 1827 ballet La Sylphide is widely considered to be the first, and the 1870 ballet Coppélia is considered to be the last.",1
"Famous ballet dancers of the Romantic era include Marie Taglioni, Fanny Elssler, and Jules Perrot.",1
"While difficult to parse modern ballet from neoclassicism, the work of these choreographers favored a greater athleticism that departed from the delicacy of ballet.",1
"Contemporary ballets may include mime and acting, and are usually set to music.",1
"Contemporary ballet is also close to contemporary dance because many contemporary ballet concepts come from the ideas and innovations of twentieth-century modern dance, including floor work and turn-in of the legs.",1
The main distinction is that ballet technique is essential to perform a contemporary ballet.,1
"Another early contemporary ballet choreographer, Twyla Tharp, choreographed Push Comes To Shove for the American Ballet Theatre in 1976, and in 1986 created In The Upper Room for her own company.",1
Today there are many contemporary ballet companies and choreographers.,1
The term ballet has evolved to include all forms associated with it.,1
"Someone training as a ballet dancer will now be expected to perform neoclassical, modern and contemporary work.",1
"A ballet dancer is expected to be able to be stately and regal for classical work, free and lyrical in neoclassical work, and unassuming, harsh or pedestrian for modern and contemporary work.",1
"Because of this, many ballet programs have historically not accepted students until approximately age 8.",1
Creative movement and non-demanding pre-ballet classes are recommended as alternatives for children.,1
"Important ballet studios teaching this method are the Miami City Ballet, Ballet Chicago Studio company, and the School of American Ballet in New York.",1
Ballet costumes have been around since the early fifteenth century.,1
European ballet was centered in the Paris Opera.,1
to create visual expression when ballet dancers perform on stage.,1
"The structure of ballet–in which a male choreographer or director uses women's bodies to express his artistic vision, while ignoring, objectifying, or silencing the women involved – has been criticized for not respecting women.",1

"Stagecraft is the technical aspect of theatrical, film, and video production.",1
Stagecraft is distinct from the wider umbrella term of scenography.,1
"In its most basic form, stagecraft may be executed by a single person who arranges all scenery, costumes, lighting, and sound, and organizes the cast.",1
Modern stagecraft is highly technical and specialized: it comprises many sub-disciplines and a vast trove of history and tradition.,1
Stagecraft during the Victorian era in England developed rapidly with the emergence of the West End.,1
Scenography is a practice of crafting stage environments or atmospheres..,1
"In the contemporary English usage, scenography is the combination of technological and material stagecrafts to represent, enact, and produce a sense of place in performance.",1
"from the term 'scenography' which is an artistic perspective concerning the visual, experiential and spatial composition of performance.",1
"The practice of scenography is thereby a holistic approach to the composition of performance and can be applied to the design or curation of events within, and outside, of the conventional theatre environment.",1

"A rehearsal is an activity in the performing arts that occurs as preparation for a performance in music, theatre, dance and related arts, such as opera, musical theatre and film production.",1
"The term ""rehearsal"" typically refers to ensemble activities undertaken by a group of people.",1
The music rehearsal takes place in a music rehearsal space.,1
"A rehearsal may involve as few as two people, as with a small play for two actors, an art song by a singer and pianist or a folk duo of a singer and guitarist.",1
"A rehearsal can involve only performers of one type, as in an a cappella choir show, in which a group of singers perform without instrumental accompaniment or a play involving only theatre actors; it can involve performers of different instruments, as with an orchestra, rock band or jazz ""big band""; vocal and instrumental performers, as with opera and choral works accompanied by orchestra; or a mix of actors, vocalists, instrumentalists and dancers, as with musical theatre.",1
"Rehearsals of small groups, such as small rock bands, jazz quartets or organ trios may be held without a leader; in these cases, the performers jointly determine how to run the rehearsal, which songs to practice, and so on.",1
"In music, the dress rehearsal is the final rehearsal before the performance; while initial rehearsals will often involve working on challenging sections of the piece or pieces, during the dress rehearsal, the piece or pieces are typically played in their entirety.",1
"Rehearsals that occur early in the production process are sometimes referred to as ""run-throughs"".",1
"A  ""dress rehearsal"" is a rehearsal or series of rehearsals in which the ensemble dresses in costume, as they will dress at the performance for the audience.",1
The dress rehearsal is often the last set of rehearsals before the concert performance and falls at the end of technical week.,1
"During initial rehearsals, the conductor frequently stops the rehearsal to ask players or sections to change the way they are playing or provide guidance to the orchestra.",1
"For musical performances, a dress rehearsal does not imply dressing in concert dress.",1
It is a final rehearsal before performance where generally the ensemble will run through the program as if there were an audience.,1
While an amateur ensemble does rehearsals for many of the same reasons as a professional ensemble—to coordinate the rhythmic ensemble and intonation—with an amateur group the conductor has to do much more teaching to the orchestra.,1
"Rehearsals are also used to teach ensemble members about music history and basic performance practice, so that they can learn the different playing styles and tones used in music from different eras.",1
"For an amateur ensemble, the rehearsals are used to give the players an opportunity to have repeated chances to learn to perform difficult passages in an ensemble context.",1
"Amateur choirs use rehearsals to build choral singing skills, such as singing with a good ensemble and with solid intonation and vocal tone.",1
Another difference between rehearsals in an amateur orchestra and a professional orchestra is the number of rehearsals.,1
"Rehearsals assemble the elements of a musical event, offering an experimental space where sounds and rhythms are put together and taken apart, played with, argued over, and refined.",1
"In these styles of music, rehearsals may be less formal than in a Classical orchestra context.",1
"However, the purpose of rehearsals is the same: to ensure that all the band members can play and/or sing their parts with a good rhythmic ensemble, correct intonation, and the right ""feel"" and style.",1
"As with Classical rehearsals, the earlier rehearsals for a show often focus more on working out the most difficult sections of songs, such as transitions from one tempo to another tempo, modulations to a new key, or coordinating a duet between two solo instruments.",1
The rehearsals closer to the performance are more likely to involve run-throughs of entire songs.,1
"Whereas Classical rehearsals are led by the conductor or choir leader, popular music band rehearsals are typically led by the bandleader, who is typically a member of the band.",1
"Theatrical constraints are various rules, either of taste or of law, that govern the production, staging, and content of stage plays in the theater.",1

"The technical rehearsal or tech rehearsal is a rehearsal that focuses on the technological aspects of the performance, in theatrical, musical, and filmed entertainment.",1
"Technical week is the week prior to the opening night of a play, musical or similar production in which all of the technical elements are present during rehearsal for the first time.",1
"During technical week all of the various technical elements are fully implemented, making the rehearsals very similar to the actual performance.",1
"Performance is completion of a task with application of knowledge, skills and abilities.",1
Task performance is related to cognitive ability while contextual performance is dependent upon personality.,1
"Task performance are behavioral roles that are recognized in job descriptions and by remuneration systems, they are directly related to organizational performance, whereas, contextual performance are value based and additional behavioral roles that are not recognized in job descriptions and covered by compensation; they are extra roles that are indirectly related to organizational performance.",1
Citizenship performance like contextual performance means a set of individual activity/contribution that supports the organizational culture.,1
"In instrumental music, performance is typically described as ""play"".",1
An effective performance is determined by achievement skills and competency of the performer - level of skill and knowledge.,1

A performance meant to be viewed by an audience.,1
"Adrian Piper and her performance Catalysis III featured the artist walking down New York City streets with her outfit painted white and a sign across her chest that said ""wet paint.""",1
"This nude performance contributes to a discourse on femininity, sexualization, and film.",1
"Performance is also dependent on adaptation of eight areas: Handling crisis, managing stress, creative problem solving, knowing necessary functional tools and skills, agile management of complex processes, interpersonal adaptability, cultural adaptability, and physical fitness.",1
"Performance is not always a result of practice, it is about honing the skill, even over practice itself can result in failure due to ego depletion.",1

"Architectural lighting design is a field within architecture, interior design  and electrical engineering that is concerned with the design of lighting systems, including natural light, electric light, or both, to serve human needs.The aim of lighting design is the human response, to see clearly and without discomfort.",1
The objective of architectural lighting design is to further the design of architecture or the experience of buildings and other physical structures.,1
"This enables architects, lighting designers, and engineers to determine whether a proposed lighting setup will deliver the amount of light intended.",1
"A specialized lighting design application is often used to create these, which typically combine the use of two-dimensional digital CAD drawings and lighting simulation software.",1
"LED technology is useful for lighting designers because of its low power consumption, low heat generation, instantaneous on-and-off control, and in the case of single color LEDs, continuity of color throughout the life of the diode and relatively low cost of manufacture.",1
"Set construction is the process undertaken by a construction manager to build full-scale scenery, as specified by a  production designer  or art director working in collaboration with the director of a production to create a set for a theatrical, film, or television production.",1

"A costume designer is a person who designs costumes for a film, stage production or television show.",1
"The role of the costume designer is to create the characters' outfits/costumes and balance the scenes with texture and colour, etc.",1
"The costume designer works alongside the director, scenic, lighting designer, sound designer, and other creative personnel.",1
"The costume designer may also collaborate with hair stylist, wig master, or makeup artist.",1
"Scenic designers come from a variety of artistic backgrounds, but in recent years, are mostly trained professionals, holding a B.F.A.",1
Scenic designers design sets and scenery that aim to support the overall artistic goals of the production.,1
The scenic designer works with the director and other designers to establish an overall visual concept for the production and design the stage environment.,1
"In the process of planning, scenic designers often make models, ranging from very basic to extremely complex.",1
"Scenic designers are responsible for creating scale models of the scenery, renderings, paint elevations and scale construction drawings as part of their communication with other production staff.",1
A sound designer is one who practices sound design.,1
"Whilst the term ""sound designer"" was not in use at this time, a number of stage managers specialised as ""effects men"", creating and performing offstage sound effects using a mix of vocal mimicry, mechanical and electrical contraptions and gramophone records.",1
The terms sound design and sound designer began to be used in the motion picture industry in 1969.,1
The term sound designer has replaced monikers like supervising sound editor or re-recording mixer for what was essentially the same position: the head designer of the final sound track.,1
"The position of Sound Designer therefore emerged in a manner similar to that of Production Designer, which was created in the 1930s when William Cameron Menzies made revolutionary contributions to the craft of art direction in the making of Gone with the Wind.The audio production team is a principal member of the production staff, with creative output comparable to that of the film editor and director of photography.",1
The sound designer for a play and the production's director work together to decide the themes and emotions to be explored.,1
"Based on this, the sound designer for plays, in collaboration with the director and possibly the composer, decides upon the sounds that will be used to create the desired moods.",1
"In some productions, the sound designer might also be hired to compose music for the play.",1
"The sound designer and the director usually work together to ""spot"" the cues in the play.",1
"Some sound designers are accomplished composers, writing and producing music for productions as well as designing sound.",1
"Theatrical Sound Designers in English Canada are represented by the Associated Designers of Canada, and in Québec by l'Association des professionnels des arts du Québec.",1
"Therefore, in interactive applications, a sound designer often collaborates with an engineer (e.g.",1
Video design or projection design is a creative field of stagecraft.,1
Video design has only recently gained recognition as a separate creative field.,1
"The role of the video designer has developed as a response to this, and in recognition of the demand in the industry for experienced professionals to handle the video content of a production.United Scenic Artists' Local 829, the Union representing Scenic Artists in the USA has included ""Projection Designers"" as of mid- 2007.",1
A video designer may take responsibility for any or all of the following.,1
"For example, a video designer may conceptually design the video content, but hire a skilled animator to create it, a programmer to program the control system, a production engineer to designer and engineer the control system and a projectionist to choose the optimum projection positions and maintain the equipment.",1
"A musical ensemble, also known as a music group or musical group, is a group of people who perform instrumental or vocal music, with the ensemble typically known by a distinct name.",1
"An orchestra is a large instrumental ensemble typical of classical music, which combines instruments from different families, including bowed string instruments such as the violin, viola, cello, and double bass, brass instruments such as the horn, trumpet, trombone and tuba, woodwinds such as the flute, oboe, clarinet and bassoon, and percussion instruments such as the timpani, bass drum, triangle, snare drum, cymbals, and mallet percussion instruments each grouped in sections.",1
A full-size Western orchestra may sometimes be called a symphony orchestra or philharmonic orchestra.,1
A chamber orchestra is a smaller-sized ensemble of about fifty musicians or fewer.,1
"Orchestras that specialize in the Baroque music of, for example, Johann Sebastian Bach and George Frideric Handel, or Classical repertoire, such as that of Haydn and Mozart, tend to be smaller than orchestras performing a Romantic music repertoire, such as the symphonies of Johannes Brahms.",1
"The typical orchestra grew in size throughout the 18th and 19th centuries, reaching a peak with the large orchestras called for in the works of Richard Wagner, and later, Gustav Mahler.",1
"Orchestras are usually led by a conductor who directs the performance with movements of the hands and arms, often made easier for the musicians to see by use of a conductor's baton.",1
"The conductor unifies the orchestra, sets the tempo and shapes the sound of the ensemble.",1
"The conductor also prepares the orchestra by leading rehearsals before the public concert, in which the conductor provides instructions to the musicians on their interpretation of the music being performed.",1
"In the Baroque music era, orchestras were often led by the concertmaster or by a chord-playing musician performing the basso continuo parts on a harpsichord or pipe organ, a tradition that some 20th-century and 21st-century early music ensembles continue.",1
"Orchestras play a wide range of repertoire, including symphonies, opera and ballet overtures, concertos for solo instruments, and as pit ensembles for operas, ballets, and some types of musical theatre.",1
"Amateur orchestras include those made up of students from an elementary school or a high school, youth orchestras, and community orchestras; the latter two typically being made up of amateur musicians from a particular city or region.",1
"The term orchestra derives from the Greek ὀρχήστρα, the name for the area in front of a stage in ancient Greek theatre reserved for the Greek chorus.",1
"By the late Romantic era, orchestras could support the most enormous forms of symphonic expression, with huge string sections, massive brass sections and an expanded range of percussion instruments.",1
"The orchestra, depending on the size, contains almost all of the standard instruments in each group.",1
"In the history of the orchestra, its instrumentation has been expanded over time, often agreed to have been standardized by the classical period and Ludwig van Beethoven's influence on the classical model.",1
"The terms symphony orchestra and philharmonic orchestra may be used to distinguish different ensembles from the same locality, such as the London Symphony Orchestra and the London Philharmonic Orchestra.",1
"A symphony orchestra will usually have over eighty musicians on its roster, in some cases over a hundred, but the actual number of musicians employed in a particular performance may vary according to the work being played and the size of the venue.",1
Chamber orchestra usually refers to smaller-sized ensembles; a major chamber orchestra might employ as many as fifty musicians; some are much smaller than that.,1
"The term concert orchestra may also be used, as in the BBC Concert Orchestra and the RTÉ Concert Orchestra.",1
The 20th-century orchestra was far more flexible than its predecessors.,1
"The first is a Baroque orchestra (i.e., J.S.",1
"Some modern orchestras also do without conductors, particularly smaller orchestras and those specializing in historically accurate performances of baroque and earlier music.",1
"However, orchestras are used sometimes in popular music, extensively in film music, and increasingly often in video game music.",1
Orchestras are also used in the symphonic metal genre.,1
"The term ""orchestra"" can also be applied to a jazz ensemble, for example in the performance of big-band music.",1

"Orchestras also hire musicians on contracts, ranging in length from a single concert to a full season or more.",1
The last major orchestra to appoint a woman to a permanent position was the Berlin Philharmonic.,1
"In April 1996, the orchestra’s press secretary wrote that ""compensating for the expected leaves of absence"" of maternity leave would be a problem.In 1997, the Vienna Philharmonic was ""facing protests during a [US] tour"" by the National Organization for Women and the International Alliance for Women in Music.",1

Community orchestras typically consist mainly of adult amateur musicians.,1
Community orchestras range in level from beginner-level orchestras which rehearse music without doing formal performances in front of an audience to intermediate-level ensembles to advanced amateur groups which play standard professional orchestra repertoire.,1
"While community orchestra members are mostly unpaid amateurs, in some orchestras, a small number of professionals may be hired to act as principal players and section leaders.",1
"Orchestras have become synonymous with the symphony, an extended musical composition in Western classical music that typically contains multiple movements which provide contrasting keys and tempos.",1
Orchestral musicians play from parts containing just the notated music for their instrument.,1
"Orchestras also perform overtures, a term originally applied to the instrumental introduction to an opera.",1
Orchestras also play with instrumental soloists in concertos.,1

"These include the Orchestra of the Age of Enlightenment, the London Classical Players under the direction of Sir Roger Norrington and the Academy of Ancient Music under Christopher Hogwood, among others.",1
"Few orchestras could fill auditoriums, and the time-honored season-subscription system became increasingly anachronistic, as more and more listeners would buy tickets on an ad hoc basis for individual events.",1
"Orchestral endowments and—more centrally to the daily operation of American orchestras—orchestral donors have seen investment portfolios shrink or produce lower yields, reducing the ability of donors to contribute; further, there has been a trend toward donors finding other social causes more compelling.",1

Carmen [kaʁ.mɛn] is an opera in four acts by French composer Georges Bizet.,1
"Carmen has since become one of the most popular and frequently performed operas in the classical canon;  the ""Habanera"" from act 1 and the ""Toreador Song"" from act 2 are among the best known of all operatic arias.",1
"Carmen initially gained its reputation through a series of productions outside France, and was not revived in Paris until 1883.",1
Later commentators have asserted that Carmen forms the bridge between the tradition of opéra comique and the realism or verismo that characterised late 19th-century Italian opera.,1
"The music of Carmen has since been widely acclaimed for brilliance of melody, harmony, atmosphere, and orchestration, and for the skill with which Bizet musically represented the emotions and suffering of his characters.",1
Carmen enters and sings her provocative habanera on the untameable nature of love.,1
"When challenged, Carmen answers with mocking defiance; Zuniga orders José to tie her hands while he prepares the prison warrant.",1

"Escamillo enters with Carmen, and they express their mutual love.",1
"Carmen has a husband called Garcia, whom José kills during a quarrel.",1
"In the novella, Carmen and José are presented much less sympathetically than they are in the opera; Bizet's biographer Mina Curtiss comments that Mérimée's Carmen, on stage, would have seemed ""an unmitigated and unconvincing monster, had her character not been simplified and deepened"".With rehearsals due to begin in October 1873, Bizet began composing in or around January of that year, and by the summer had completed the music for the first act and perhaps sketched more.",1
"The two principals, José and Carmen, lie outside the genre.",1
"Curtiss suggests that Carmen's character, spiritually and musically, may be a realisation of the composer's own unconscious longing for a freedom denied to him by his stifling marriage.",1
"Harold C. Schonberg likens Carmen to ""a female Don Giovanni.",1
"Carmen was often performed to half-empty houses, even when the management gave away large numbers of tickets.",1

"After the final performance, Carmen was not seen in Paris again until 1883.",1
"On 17 June 1878 Carmen was produced in London, at Her Majesty's Theatre, where Minnie Hauk began her long association with the part of Carmen.",1
"Carmen was also acclaimed in numerous French provincial cities including Marseille, Lyon and, in 1881, Dieppe, where Galli-Marié returned to the role.",1
Thereafter Carmen was quickly incorporated into the Met's regular repertory.,1
"Carmen's habanera from act 1, and the toreador's song ""Votre toast"" from act 2, are among the most popular and best-known of all operatic arias, the latter ""a splendid piece of swagger"" according to Newman, ""against which the voices and the eyebrows of purists have long been raised in vain"".",1
"Meanwhile, Carmen's popularity endures; according to Macdonald: ""The memorability of Bizet's tunes will keep the music of Carmen alive in perpetuity"", and its status as a popular classic is unchallenged by any other French opera.",1
"Carmen's habanera is based on an idiomatic song, ""El Arreglito"", by the Spanish composer Sebastián Yradier.",1
"José's insistence that, despite Carmen's blandishments, he must return to duty leads to a quarrel; the arrival of Zuniga, the consequent fight and José's unavoidable ensnarement into the lawless life culminates musically in the triumphant hymn to freedom that closes the act.",1
"As José kills Carmen, the chorus sing the refrain of the Toreador Song off-stage; the fate motif, which has been suggestively present at various points during the act, is heard fortissimo, together with a brief reference to Carmen's card scene music.",1
"The character ""Carmen"" has been a regular subject of film treatment since the earliest days of cinema.",1
"The Preminger film, Carmen Jones, is based on the 1943 Oscar Hammerstein's Broadway musical of the same name, itself an adaptation of the opera.",1

"Activision later revealed that both Guitar Hero 5 and Band Hero would support playing songs from both Guitar Hero World Tour and Guitar Hero Smash Hits, with music licensing being the only limiting factor on which songs could be made forward-compatible.The large number of Guitar Hero and Rock Band titles on the market is considered to be partially responsible for the sharp decline of music game sales in the latter half of 2009, along with the effects of the late-2000s recession.",1

"Judaism is an ethnic religion comprising the collective religious, cultural and legal tradition and civilization of the Jewish people.",1
Judaism is considered by religious Jews to be the expression of the covenant that God established with the Children of Israel.,1
"Within Judaism there are a variety of movements, most of which emerged from Rabbinic Judaism, which holds that God revealed his laws and commandments to Moses on Mount Sinai in the form of both the Written and Oral Torah.",1
Modern branches of Judaism such as Humanistic Judaism may be nontheistic.,1
"Orthodox Judaism maintains that the Torah and Jewish law are divine in origin, eternal and unalterable, and that they should be strictly followed.",1
"Conservative and Reform Judaism are more liberal, with Conservative Judaism generally promoting a more traditionalist interpretation of Judaism's requirements than Reform Judaism.",1
"Judaism's texts, traditions and values strongly influenced later Abrahamic religions, including Christianity, Islam and the Baha'i Faith.",1
Judaism thus begins with ethical monotheism: the belief that God is one and is concerned with the actions of mankind.,1
"Judaism also universally recognizes the Biblical Covenant between God and the Patriarch Abraham as well as the additional aspects of the Covenant revealed to Moses, who is considered Judaism's greatest prophet.",1
"In turn, Solomon Schechter's Conservative Judaism was identical with the tradition understood as the interpretation of Torah, in itself being the history of the constant updates and adjustment of the Law performed by means of the creative interpretation.",1

Orthodox Judaism holds that both the Written and Oral Torah were divinely revealed to Moses and that the laws within it are binding and unchanging.,1
"Haredi Judaism is less accommodating to modernity and has less interest in non-Jewish disciplines, and it may be distinguished from Modern Orthodox Judaism in practice by its styles of dress and more stringent practices.",1
"Subsets of Haredi Judaism include Hasidic Judaism, which is rooted in the Kabbalah and distinguished by reliance on a Rebbe or religious teacher; and Sephardic Haredi Judaism, which emerged among Sephardic Jews in Israel.Conservative Judaism is characterized by a commitment to traditional Jewish laws and customs, including observance of Shabbat and kashrut, a deliberately non-fundamentalist teaching of Jewish principles of faith, a positive attitude toward modern culture, and an acceptance of both traditional rabbinic and modern scholarship when considering Jewish religious texts.",1
"Conservative Judaism teaches that Jewish law is not static, but has always developed in response to changing conditions.",1
"Conservative Judaism holds that the Oral Law is divine and normative, but holds that both the Written and Oral Law may be interpreted by the rabbis to reflect modern sensibilities and suit modern conditions.",1
"Reform Judaism, called Liberal or Progressive Judaism in many countries, defines Judaism in relatively universalist terms, rejects most of the ritual and ceremonial laws of the Torah while observing moral laws, and emphasizes the ethical call of the Prophets.",1
Reform Judaism has developed an egalitarian prayer service in the vernacular and emphasizes personal connection to Jewish tradition.,1
"Reconstructionist Judaism, like Reform Judaism, does not hold that Jewish law, as such, requires observance, but unlike Reform, Reconstructionist thought emphasizes the role of the community in deciding what observances to follow.",1
Humanistic Judaism is a small non-theistic movement centered in North America and Israel that emphasizes Jewish culture and history as the sources of Jewish identity.,1
"Sephardi and Mizrahi observance of Judaism tends toward the conservative, and prayer rites are reflective of this, with the text of each rite being largely unchanged since their respective inception.",1

"Modern Orthodox Judaism developed in reaction to Reform Judaism, by leaders who argued that Jews could participate in public life as citizens equal to Christians while maintaining the observance of Jewish law.",1
The differences between Christianity and Judaism originally centered on whether Jesus was the Jewish Messiah but eventually became irreconcilable.,1
"Due to these differences, Judaism traditionally regards Christianity as Shituf or worship of the God of Israel which is not monotheistic.",1
"Christianity has traditionally regarded Judaism as obsolete with the invention of Christianity and Jews as a people replaced by the Church, though a Christian belief in dual-covenant theology emerged as a phenomenon following Christian reflection on how their theology influenced the Nazi Holocaust.",1

"the article, ""Grassroots Progressive Christianity: A Quiet Revolution"" by Hal Taussig published in 'The Fourth R,' May–June 2006.
the working definition utilized in Roger Wolsey's book Kissing Fish: Christianity for People Who Don't Like Christianity:[...] Progressive Christianity is an approach to the Christian faith that is influenced by post-liberalism and postmodernism and: proclaims Jesus of Nazareth as Christ, Savior, and Lord; emphasizes the Way and teachings of Jesus, not merely His person; emphasizes God's immanence not merely God's transcendence; leans toward panentheism rather than supernatural theism; emphasizes salvation here and now instead of primarily in heaven later; emphasizes being saved for robust, abundant/eternal life over being saved from hell; emphasizes the social/communal aspects of salvation instead of merely the personal; stresses social justice as integral to Christian discipleship; takes the Bible seriously but not necessarily literally, embracing a more interpretive, metaphorical understanding; emphasizes orthopraxy instead of orthodoxy; embraces reason as well as paradox and mystery — instead of blind allegiance to rigid doctrines and dogmas; does not consider homosexuality to be sinful; and does not claim that Christianity is the only valid or viable way to connect to God.",1

"Atheism is accepted as a valid philosophical position within some varieties of Hinduism, Jainism, and Buddhism.Philosophers such as Slavoj Žižek, Alain de Botton, and Alexander Bard and Jan Söderqvist, have all argued that atheists should reclaim religion as an act of defiance against theism, precisely not to leave religion as an unwarranted monopoly to theists.",1
"Baggini argues that atheism is a superior basis for ethics, claiming that a moral basis external to religious imperatives is necessary to evaluate the morality of the imperatives themselves—to be able to discern, for example, that ""thou shalt steal"" is immoral even if one's religion instructs it—and that atheists, therefore, have the advantage of being more inclined to make such evaluations.",1
"The term atheism was derived from the French athéisme, and appears in English about 1587.",1
"""Atheism was first used to describe a self-avowed belief in late 18th-century Europe, specifically denoting disbelief in the monotheistic Abrahamic god.",1
